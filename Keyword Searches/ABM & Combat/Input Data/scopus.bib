abstract={The World Health Organization has activated a global preparedness plan to improve response to avian influenza outbreaks, control outbreaks, and avoid an H5N1 pandemic. The effectiveness of the plan will greatly benefit from identification of epicenters and temporal analysis of outbreaks. Accordingly, we have developed a simulation-based methodology to analyze the spread of H5N1 using stochastic interactions between waterfowl, poultry, and humans. We have incorporated our methodology into a user friendly, extensible software environment called SEARUMS. SEARUMS is an acronym for Studying the Epidemiology of Avian Influenza Rapidly Using Modeling and Simulation. It enables rapid scenario analysis to identify epicenters and timelines of H5N1 outbreaks using existing statistical data. The case studies conducted using SEARUMS have yielded results that coincide with several past outbreaks and provide non-intuitive inferences about global spread of H5N1. This article presents the methodology used for modeling the global epidemiology of avian influenza and discusses its impacts on human and poultry morbidity and mortality. The results obtained from the various case studies and scenario analyses conducted using SEARUMS along with verification experiments are also discussed. The experiments illustrate that SEARUMS has considerable potential to empower researchers, national organizations, and medical response teams with timely knowledge to combat the disease, mitigate its adverse effects, and avert a pandemic. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The increasing incidence of osteoporosis worldwide requires anabolic treatments that are safe, effective, and, critically, inexpensive given the prevailing overburdened health care systems. While vigorous skeletal loading is anabolic and holds promise, deficits in mechanotransduction accrued with age markedly diminish the efficacy of readily complied, exercisebased strategies to combat osteoporosis in the elderly. Our approach to explore and counteract these age-related deficits was guided by cellular signaling patterns across hierarchical scales and by the insight that cell responses initiated during transient, rare events hold potential to exert high-fidelity control over temporally and spatially distant tissue adaptation. Here, we present an agent-based model of real-time Ca2+/NFAT signaling amongst bone cells that fully described periosteal bone formation induced by a wide variety of loading stimuli in young and aged animals. The model predicted age-related pathway alterations underlying the diminished bone formation at senescence, and hence identified critical deficits that were promising targets for therapy. Based upon model predictions, we implemented an in vivo intervention and show for the first time that supplementing mechanical stimuli with low-dose Cyclosporin A can completely rescue loading induced bone formation in the senescent skeleton. These pre-clinical data provide the rationale to consider this approved pharmaceutical alongside mild physical exercise as an inexpensive, yet potent therapy to augment bone mass in the elderly. Our analyses suggested that real-time cellular signaling strongly influences downstream bone adaptation to mechanical stimuli, and quantification of these otherwise inaccessible, transient events in silico yielded a novel intervention with clinical potential. © 2010 Srinivasan et al.},

abstract={We present a simulation model of current conflict-torn Afghanistan in which a system-dynamics model is coupled with an agent-based model. Agent-based modeling techniques are applied to model individual cognition and behavior as well as group formation processes. System-dynamics modeling is used for representing macro conflict processes, such as duration of violence and combat success ratio. The cognitive and behavioral processes are couched in a socio-cultural context and feed into the system dynamics processes. This affords us exploring the relationship between local socio-culturally-driven cognition and behavior and (dynamic) macro properties of armed conflict. We demonstrate the importance of analyzing conflict-torn Afghanistan from an interplay of adapting "traditional" socio-cultural mechanisms, political culture and power structures, and politico-economic macro-processes. We find that variations in the conflict's superstructure can be explained through variations in socio-culturally dependent structures. The model indicates limitations with regard to classical prediction, but is promising with regard to explanatory-driven pattern forecasting. © 2010 International Studies Association.},

abstract={One of a new generation of combat models is examined to determine how its behaviour differs from older approaches based on first-order linear differential equations. This new methodology, which uses 'cellular automaton' or 'agent-based' models, has been around for a decade, prompting closer scrutiny. The method gives entities within a combat simulation the autonomy to react to circumstances in their local area. The reaction is determined by each entity's 'personality'. It is found that the automata tend to either fight as a massed force, or form dispersed patterns of clusters within clusters. Such a pattern is known as a 'fractal'. By adopting this pattern, a non-intuitive relationship between the kill probability of the automata and the force attrition rate develops. This provides a compelling example of how the result presented by earlier workers-that automaton models may evolve into fractal distributions-can have significance for operational researchers.},

abstract={Many combat and agent-based models use time-step as their simulation time advance mechanism. Since time discretization is known to affect the results when numerically solving differential equations, it stands to reason that it might likewise affect the results of such simulations. This paper demonstrates that is indeed the case. Using simple queueing models, we demonstrate that the size of the time step can have a substantial impact on estimated measures of performance. While large time steps can execute faster than a corresponding discrete event model, there can be substantial errors in the estimates. Conversely, with small time steps the results match both the discrete event measures as well as the analytic values, but can take substantially longer to execute. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Evolving agent-based simulations enables one to automate the difficult iterative process of modeling complex adaptive systems to exhibit pre-specified/desired behaviors. Nevertheless this emerging technology, combining research advances in agent-based modeling/simulation and evolutionary computation, requires significant computing resources (i.e., high performance computing facilities) to evaluate simulation models across a large search space. Moreover, such experiments are typically conducted in an infrequent fashion and may occur when the computing facilities are not fully available. The user may thus be confronted with a computing budget limiting the use of these "evolvable simulation" techniques. We propose the use of the cloud computing paradigm to address these budget and flexibility issues. To assist this research, we utilize a modular evolutionary framework coined CASE (for complex adaptive system evolver) which is capable of evolving agent-based models using nature-inspired search algorithms. In this paper, we present an adaptation of this framework which supports the cloud computing paradigm. An example evolutionary experiment, which examines a simplified military scenario modeled with the agent-based simulation platform MANA, is presented. This experiment refers to Automated Red Teaming: a vulnerability assessment tool employed by defense analysts to study combat operations (which are regarded here as complex adaptive systems). The experimental results suggest promising research potential in exploiting the cloud computing paradigm to support computing intensive evolvable simulation experiments. Finally, we discuss an additional extension to our cloud computing compliant CASE in which we propose to incorporate a distributed evolutionary approach, e.g., the island-based model to further optimize the evolutionary search.},

abstract={More than one billion people will face water scarcity within the next ten years due to climate change and unsustainable water usage, and this number is only expected to grow exponentially in the future. At current water use rates, supply-side demand management is no longer an effective way to combat water scarcity. Instead, many municipalities and water agencies are looking to demand-side solutions to prevent major water loss. While changing conservation behavior is one demand-based strategy, there is a growing movement toward the adoption of water conservation technology as a way to solve water resource depletion. Installing technology into one's household requires additional costs and motivation, creating a gap between the overall potential households that could adopt this technology, and how many actually do. This study identified and modeled a variety of demographic and household characteristics, social network influence, and external factors such as water price and rebate policy to see their effect on residential water conservation technology adoption. Using Agent-based Modeling and data obtained from the City of Miami Beach, the coupled effects of these factors were evaluated to examine the effectiveness of different pathways towards the adoption of more water conservation technologies. The results showed that income growth and water pricing structure, more so than any of the demographic or building characteristics, impacted household adoption of water conservation technologies. The results also revealed that the effectiveness of rebate programs depends on conservation technology cost and the affluence of the community. Rebate allocation did influence expensive technology adoption, with the potential to increase the adoption rate by 50%. Additionally, social network connections were shown to have an impact on the rate of adoption independent of price strategy or rebate status. These findings will lead the way for municipalities and other water agencies to more strategically implement interventions to encourage household technology adoption based on the characteristics of their communities. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Dental caries or tooth decay is a prevalent global disease whose causative agent is the oral biofilm known as plaque. According to the ecological plaque hypothesis, this biofilm becomes pathogenic when external challenges drive it towards a state with a high proportion of acid-producing bacteria. Determining which factors control biofilm composition is therefore desirable when developing novel clinical treatments to combat caries, but is also challenging due to the system complexity and the existence of multiple bacterial species performing similar functions. Here we employ agent-based mathematical modelling to simulate a biofilm consisting of two competing, distinct types of bacterial populations, each parameterised by their nutrient uptake and aciduricity, periodically subjected to an acid challenge resulting from the metabolism of dietary carbohydrates. It was found that one population was progressively eliminated from the system to give either a benign or a pathogenic biofilm, with a tipping point between these two fates depending on a multiplicity of factors relating to microbial physiology and biofilm geometry. Parameter sensitivity was quantified by individually varying the model parameters against putative experimental measures, suggesting non-lethal interventions that can favourably modulate biofilm composition. We discuss how the same parameter sensitivity data can be used to guide the design of validation experiments, and argue for the benefits of in silico modelling in providing an additional predictive capability upstream from in vitro experiments. © 2014 Head et al.},

abstract={Combat, unlike many real-world processes, tends to be singular in nature. This makes statistical analysis of the combat data problematic. Building stochastic simulation models of combat scenarios provides a means of studying in some detail the particulars of a combat scenario provided that the model accurately captures the scenario. The scenario of interest in this paper is the WWII Bay of Biscay U-boat campaign, and the model is an agent-based simulation. The challenge is how to validate, or ensure the adequacy of, the simulation representation of the combat scenario with the actual scenario on the basis of comparing simulation output to typically small-sample-size actual combat data. In this paper we give the details of a new statistical methodology for use in validating a mission-level, agent-based model of a historical combat scenario. We use the Bay of Biscay agent-based simulation and develop a bootstrapping technique applied to the small-sample-size actual data from the Bay of Biscay campaign. Results from this bootstrapping statistical technique are compared with commonly used statistical techniques and are shown to improve the comparison of agent-based simulation output to actual real-world data. © 2009, The Societyfor Modeling and Simulation International.

abstract={Agent-based models have been used to capture and analyze the essential behaviors of combat units although the number of agents used has been fairly low. We experiment with a microscopically detailed agent model in which over 20,000 soldiers are represented individually (one agent per soldier) in a simulation of the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879. We describe how a rule based model can be specified for soldiers on both sides and how it can be specialized for different skill sets and fighting capabilities of soldier agents belonging to particular units. We address some of the challenges of programming a model consisting of large numbers of agents. We demonstrate that our model provides a simulation of the battle with considerable historical accuracy and then go on to show how the same model can be used to demonstrate a plausible alternative to history. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Reduced manning requirements and other cost reducing measures have spurred interest in automation of engineering plants onboard naval combat vessels. Furthermore, automation may increase resiliency of shipboard engineering plants when compared to the current generation of manually configured plants. This paper presents a control algorithm and deployment strategy which supervises a ship's chilled water plant to control the temperature of thermal loads (e.g., air chillers, electrical components). Redundant computation and communication capabilities motivates the use of an agent-based controller (ABC) enabled through a peer-to-peer wireless network. In the architecture presented, each agent sits on one or more digraphs corresponding to the utility generated by the fluid exiting the chilled water plant at each discharge point. Each digraph is a component of the decentralized model-predictive controller (MPC). Performance of the proposed control architecture is tested in simulation, and is shown to approach the performance of an effective, but computationally. © 2012 AACC American Automatic Control Council).},

abstract={To explore the complexity of temporal and spatial dynamics of an agricultural landscape under various external and internal driven scenarios, SimKat, an agent-based model, has been developed with the simulation computer program CORMAS. This model combines simplified bio-physical processes of land cover, regional dry-land salinity changes, rainfall impact on productivity, farm profitability and the complexity of land-use decisions of individual farmers in a dry-land agricultural catchment (no irrigation). In this model, simulated farmers formulate individual decisions dealing with land-use changes based on the combined performance of their past land cover productivity and market returns. The willingness to adapt to market drivers and the ability to maximize returns vary between farmers. In addition, farmers in the model can demonstrate various attitudes towards dry-land salinity mitigation as a consequence of experiencing and perceiving salinity on their farm, in the neighborhood or across the entire region. Consequently, farmers can adopt land cover strategies aimed at reducing dry-land salinity. Aggregating the simulated individual behavior of farmers combined with historical rainfall and market price records, reproduced similar aggregated trends of land-cover changes, regional salinity change and farm number decline as observed in the last 20 years in the subject region (Katanning, Western Australia). Using the model in an initial exploratory study on the impact of rainfall variability and change highlighted the importance of average rainfall decline and the widespread willingness of farmers to adapt perennial vegetation in their farming systems to combat regional dry-land salinity. Rainfall decline, as one of the observed consequences of climate change in this region, can also lead to prolonged sequences of dry seasons in the future. Adaptation by farmers to sequences of dry and wet seasons, rather than an average trend in rainfall, seems to be critical for farm survival in this region. Intensifying cropping during wet seasons to maximize farm returns can increase vulnerability in subsequent periods of dry seasons, in particular where alternative income from pasture and sheep production has been lost in the adaptation process. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Agents are self-contained objects within a software model that are capable of autonomously interacting with the environment and with other agents. Basing a model around agents (building an agent-based model, or ABM) allows the user to build complex models from the bottom up by specifying agent behaviors and the environment within which they operate. This is often a more natural perspective than the system-level perspective required of other modeling paradigms, and it allows greater flexibility to use agents in novel applications. This flexibility makes them ideal as virtual laboratories and testbeds, particularly in the social sciences where direct experimentation may be infeasible or unethical. ABMs have been applied successfully in a broad variety of areas, including heuristic search methods, social science models, combat modeling, and supply chains. This tutorial provides an introduction to tools and resources for prospective modelers, and illustrates ABM flexibility with a basic war-gaming example. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We present here a general method for modelling the dynamics of battles among social animals. The proposed method exploits the procedures widely used to model chemical reactions, but still uncommon in behavioural studies. We applied this methodology to the interpretation of experimental observations of battles between two species of ants (Lasius neglectus and Lasius paralienus), but this scheme may have a wider applicability and can be extended to other species as well. We performed two types of experiment labelled as interaction and mortality. The interaction experiments are designed to obtain information on the combat dynamics and lasted one hour. The mortality ones provide information on the casualty rates of the two species and lasted five hours. We modelled the interactions among ants using a chemical model which considers the single ant individuals and fighting groups analogously to atoms and molecules. The mean-field behaviour of the model is described by a set of non-linear differential equations. We also performed stochastic simulations of the corresponding agent-based model by means of the Gillespie event-driven integration scheme. By fitting the stochastic trajectories with the deterministic model, we obtained the probability distribution of the reaction parameters. The main result that we obtained is a dominance phase diagram, that gives the average trajectory of a generic battle, for an arbitrary number of opponents. This phase diagram was validated with some extra experiments. With respect to other war models (e.g., Lanchester's ones), our chemical model considers all phases of the battle and not only casualties. This allows a more detailed description of the battle (with a larger number of parameters), allowing the development of more sophisticated models (e.g., spatial ones), with the goal of distinguishing collective effects from the strategic ones. © 2014 Santarlasci et al.},

abstract={Artificial-life techniques - specifically, agent-based models and evolutionary learning algorithms - provide a potentially powerful new approach to understanding some of the fundamental processes of war. This paper introduces a simple artificial-like "toy model" of combat called Enhanced ISAAC Neural Simulation Tool (EINSTein). EINSTein is designed to illustrate how certain aspects of land combat can be viewed as self-organized, emergent phenomena resulting from the dynamical web of interactions among notional combatants. EINSTein's bottom-up, synthesist approach to the modeling of combat stands in stark contrast to the more traditional top-down, or reductionist approach taken by conventional military models, and represents a step toward developing a complex systems theoretic toolbox for identifying, exploring, and possibly exploiting self-organized emergent collective patterns of behavior on the real battlefield. A description of the model is provided, along with examples of emergent agent patterns and behaviors.},

abstract={As the battle continues against hospital-acquired infections and the concurrent rise in antibiotic resistance among many of the major causative pathogens, there is a dire need to conduct controlled experiments, in order to compare proposed control strategies. However, cost, time, and ethical considerations make this evaluation strategy either impractical or impossible to implement with living patients. This paper presents a multi-scale model that offers promise as the basis for a tool to simulate these (and other) controlled experiments. This is a “unified” model in two important ways: (i) It combines inter-host and in-host dynamics into a single model, and (ii) it links two very different modeling approaches - agent-based modeling and differential equations - into a single model. The potential of this model as an instrument to combat antibiotic resistance in hospitals is demonstrated with numerical examples. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Peer review is ubiquitous in modern science: from the evaluation of publications to the distribution of funding. While there is a long tradition of, and many arguments for, peer review as a beneficial and necessary component of scientific processes, the exponential growth of the research community, the 'publish or perish' pressures and increasing insecurity and competition for research grants have led to an increasing number of voices describing the weaknesses of the system. One of the most frequent accusations against the peer review system is that it inhibits true innovation. The availability of better data mining tools allows interested stakeholders, in principle, to monitor many aspects of the process and to promote a better understanding of the interplay of various factors. 'In principle' – because a lot of information is hidden behind the screens of anonymity and confidentiality. Our work presents an attempt at a theoretical understanding of some aspects of the process via an idealized agent-based model, which describes the effects of the peer review done by 'imperfect' agents, in particular with respect to promotion of mediocrity and to formation of self-serving cliques. The results of the model suggest that both phenomena can be quite robust and require careful monitoring of the system to combat their negative effects. Some mitigating measures are simulated and discussed. © JASSS.},

abstract={This research proposes a conceptual model to make significant progress in augmented cognition. We intend to design a generic architecture to improve the collective situational awareness (SA) of a team of soldiers on the battlefield during combat effects, and cultural communications. It also establishes a training outline for future landscapes of a similar nature by providing convincing feedback. It will serve as architecture of a model, based on the current laboratory framework. This involves data analysis of the feedback from the neurophysiological body sensors (heart rate, skin temperature, breathing rate and others) placed on a wearable immersive training vest. It includes gesture tracking gloves and fixed spatial locators. Approximately 15 soldiers will be incorporated into the study. Various training scenarios will be designed to capture all possible body perturbations, movements, and interactions. A similar agent-based model (ABM) of the training environment will be created to augment the soldier's cognitive competencies. ABM will integrate social systems interaction complexity into the decision making capability of the soldier in real time. Automated feedback can be provided using the model developed in the event of any social faux pas via gesture tracking and monitoring cognitive capacity. Model can help discover novel talents and render knowledge during training scenarios. © 2013 The authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We investigate the effects of time advance mechanisms on the behavior of agents in combat simulations using some simple scenarios relevant to combat and agent-based models. We implement these simulation designs in two modeling packages that illustrate the differences between discrete-time simulation (DTS) and discrete-event simulation (DES) methodologies. Many combat models use DTS as their simulation time advance mechanism. We demonstrate that the presence and size of the time step as a modeling component can have a substantial impact on the basic characteristics of agent and simulation performance. We show that the use of a DTS method can degrade the modeling accuracy of changes in agent sensor range and detection outcomes, and also can compromise the ability of agents to travel to specific target destinations in a spatial simulation environment. We conclude that DES methodology successfully addresses these problems and is preferred as a time advance mechanism in these situations. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Using an agent-based model as a 'battlefield laboratory', we explore equations of combat attrition which extend beyond the conventional Lanchester equations and which endeavour to encapsulate the more complex aspects of warfare. Our approach compares predictions from candidate attrition equations with casualty data generated artificially from an agent-based model. For situations where the initial regimented structure of the fighting forces breaks down, introducing fractal concepts into the attrition equations proves effective at encapsulating complex aspects of the battle; with details in the time dependence of the casualty data able to be reproduced. Furthermore, measuring the fractal dimension of a fighting force's spatial distribution on the battlefield provides a sensitive probe of the combatants' behaviour. Precise times at which key events occur during a battle can be pinpointed. This study furthers the body of work which considers warfare as a complex adaptive system and where fractal-like structures are expected to emerge. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract={New weapons system analysis is a field with much interest and study due to the enduring requirement for militaries to improve their set of tactical capabilities. Moreover, as development, testing, fielding, and employment of any new weapon system can be quite costly, justifications of acquisition decisions must be deliberate and thorough to improve necessary capabilities at the least possible cost. Informing these decisions, via analyses of the weapons systems’ benefits and costs, yields better decisions. Our goal herein is to demonstrate a sound methodology to efficiently attain information about the potential benefits, known as key performance parameters (KPPs), of a particular weapon system. Utilizing a simple, unclassified scenario, we identify benefits that the small advanced capability missile (SACM) concept provides, and we demonstrate a basis for further investigation into the tactics used to leverage its capabilities. Within this study, we substitute unclassified data from Lockheed Martin’s Cuda prototype for the SACM concept. Furthermore, we discuss how each of the chosen study factors influences the air combat scenario. Ultimately, we establish the usefulness of a designed experimental approach to analysis of agent-based combat simulation models, which yields useful insights during the acquisition process about the complex interactions of different actors on the battlefield. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Human self-initiated behavior against epidemics is recognized to have significant impacts on disease spread. A few epidemic models have incorporated self-initiated behavior, and most of them are based on a classic population-based approach, which assumes a homogeneous population and a perfect mixing pattern, thus failing to capture heterogeneity among individuals, such as their responsive behavior to diseases. This article proposes an agent-based model that combines epidemic simulation with a relative agreement model for individual self-initiated behavior. This model explicitly represents discrete individuals, their contact structure, and most importantly, their progressive decision making processes, thus characterizing individualized response to disease risks. The model simulation and sensitivity analysis show the existence of critical points (threshold values) in the model parameter space to control influenza epidemic including minimum values for the initially positive population size, the communication rate, and the attitude uncertainty. These threshold effects shed insights on preventive strategy design to deal with the current circumstances that new vaccines are often insufficient to combat emerging communicable diseases. © JASSS.},

abstract={Background: Global efforts to address the burden of malaria have stagnated in recent years with malaria cases beginning to rise. Substandard and falsified anti-malarial treatments contribute to this stagnation. Poor quality anti-malarials directly affect health outcomes by increasing malaria morbidity and mortality, as well as threaten the effectiveness of treatment by contributing to artemisinin resistance. Research to assess the scope and impact of poor quality anti-malarials is essential to raise awareness and allocate resources to improve the quality of treatment. A probabilistic agent-based model was developed to provide country-specific estimates of the health and economic impact of poor quality anti-malarials on paediatric malaria. This paper presents the methodology and case study of the Substandard and Falsified Antimalarial Research Impact (SAFARI) model developed and applied to Uganda. Results: The total annual economic impact of malaria in Ugandan children under age five was estimated at US$614 million. Among children who sought medical care, the total economic impact was estimated at $403 million, including $57.7 million in direct costs. Substandard and falsified anti-malarials were a significant contributor to this annual burden, accounting for $31 million (8% of care-seeking children) in total economic impact involving $5.2 million in direct costs. Further, 9% of malaria deaths relating to cases seeking treatment were attributable to poor quality anti-malarials. In the event of widespread artemisinin resistance in Uganda, we simulated a 12% yearly increase in costs associated with paediatric malaria cases that sought care, inflicting $48.5 million in additional economic impact annually. Conclusions: Improving the quality of treatment is essential to combat the burden of malaria and prevent the development of drug resistance. The SAFARI model provides country-specific estimates of the health and economic impact of substandard and falsified anti-malarials to inform governments, policy makers, donors and the malaria community about the threat posed by poor quality medicines. The model findings are useful to illustrate the significance of the issue and inform policy and interventions to improve medicinal quality. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective Philadelphia passed a 1·5-cent-per-ounce sweetened beverage tax (SBT). Revenue will fund 10 000 quality pre-kindergarten slots for poor children. It is imperative to understand how revenue from SBT can be used to fund programmes to address education and other social determinants of health. The objective of the present study was to simulate quality pre-kindergarten attendance, educational achievement and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among Philadelphia children and adolescents under six intervention scenarios: (i) no intervention; (ii) 10 000 additional quality pre-kindergarten slots; (iii) a 1·5-cent-per-ounce SBT; (iv) expanded pre-kindergarten and 1·5-cent-per-ounce SBT; (v) a 3-cent-per-ounce SBT; and (vi) expanded pre-kindergarten and 3-cent-per-ounce SBT. Design We used an agent-based model to estimate pre-kindergarten enrolment, educational achievement and SSB consumption under the six policy scenarios. We identified key parameters in the model from the published literature and secondary analyses of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement. Setting Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Subjects Philadelphia children and adolescents aged 4-18 years. Results A 1·5-cents-per-ounce tax would reduce SSB consumption by 1·3 drinks/week among Philadelphia children and adolescents relative to no intervention, with larger effects among children below the poverty level. Quality pre-kindergarten expansion magnifies the effect of the SBT by 8 %, but has the largest effect on moderate-income children just above the poverty level. The SBT and quality pre-kindergarten programme each reduce SSB consumption, but primarily benefit different children and adolescents. Conclusions Pairing an excise tax with a complementary programme to improve a social determinant of health represents a progressive strategy to combat obesity, a disease regressive in its social patterning. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Network centric operations (NCO) has been dubbed the most significant revolution in military affairs (RMA) in the past 200 years. The promise of NCO is based on the notion that information sharing and connectivity is fundamental to the effectiveness of a combat force. This is due to the ability of a properly networked force to self-synchronise itself as it engages enemy forces. The information age combat model (IACM) is a popular representation of NCO. Previous research at modelling the IACM has so far focused solely at using agent-based modelling. That work produced significant contributions to the IACM literature. However, it has proven to be computationally expensive. IACM simulations must be sustainable as research into IACM evolves and more NCO complexities are introduced. This research will propose a discrete-event simulation (DES) approach to model the IACM. The paper will present the basis upon which DES was selected for this purpose and will illustrate how the DES approach can provide significant improvements in terms of the time and computational power needed to run IACM simulations.

Previous studies have modelledthis particular unit as either an abstract entity or a detailed behaviour model without C2. Our model includes C2 in the models todetermine the most critical tasks at company level C2 because this information could direct company commanders to engage inmore important operational tasks. Our analysis is based on agent-based modelling and the virtual experiment framework. Theoverall model includes operational details as discrete event models and soldier behaviour as behavioural models. Our analyticalresults enable us to identify the key C2 tasks of company commanders and the changes in the importance of variousoperational environments. © JASSS.},

abstract={Morale dominates soldiers' behaviors and combat effectiveness. Recruits' group morale always gets stuck in a low level due to the gap between the real army and their imaginary one. It's important to find a solution to increase the morale effectively in the first few days and keep it steady in the following days. In this paper, first four core behavioral attributes that affect the morale, in the view of organizational behavior, are refined, then the recruit agent model based on agent-based modeling (ABM) is built, next rules for four modules, which are oral praise module, motion module, interaction module and morale recession module, are set on the recruits, and finally four simulation experiments are conducted. With the collaboration of the four modules, recruits' group morale grows significantly in the first ninety days and keeps steady in the later days. Some abnormal agents' individual morale changes are also studied. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter presents the science of complex systems that had a significant impact on the way Western militaries understand and operate within exceedingly complex and dangerous environments. With the development of new methodologies, tools and techniques within complex systems, current military practices have been re-examined, and many have been found to be consistent with complex systems theory. In this case, complex systems provide theoretical support to explain why best practice works. Complex systems theory may also provide clues as to what changes in the context would cause current best practice to fail. In other instances, complex systems challenge the status quo. Agent-based models of combat help reveal the limitations of mechanistic, detailed, physical war games as representations of battlefield dynamics. Adaptive Campaigning challenges the military transformation advocates' concept of information dominance, by arguing that armies will have to continue to fight for, rather than with, information. According to Adaptive Campaigning, acting on the basis of incomplete information will always be necessary to stimulate the system and assess its response. Whether or not it aligns with current practice, complex systems provide a valuable contribution to military theory. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As the Department of Defense transitions to a ubiquitous computing environment, our military operations become increasingly vulnerable to compromise via cyber attacks at echelons as low as the Brigade Combat Team (BCT). There is a need to design a system to facilitate the analysis of a nation state's ability to compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of a deployed tactical network. Research demonstrated that, on these networks, compromises due to security protocols violated by humans are much more common than compromises due to technological vulnerabilities. Therefore, this analysis focuses on developing a simulation modeling approach to analyze the effectiveness of security protocols "within the fortress" and to track the damage done by various forms of cyber attacks that have successfully breached the network perimeter. Our network model uses agent-based simulation in order to model the flow of information at the packet level with dictated behavior specific to the agents modeled: individual network packets, computer systems, routers, servers, and files. The advantage to using an agent-based, rather than a discrete-event, simulation model in this situation is that agent-based models focus on the relationship between entities from the bottom-up, such as at the network packet level, rather than the entire system from the top-down. The developed simulation model allows us to simulate various network attacks, observe their interaction with network security protocols, assess the resulting damage in terms of the network's availability, and quantify the damage in terms of sensitive information lost. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Humans and animals react in recognizable ways to surprising events. However, there is a lack of models that generate surprise intensity and its effects on behaviour in a realistic way, leading to impoverished and non-humanlike behaviour of agents in situations where humans would react surprised. To fill in this gap in agent-based modelling, a computational model is developed based on psychological empirical findings and theories from literature with which agents can display surprised behaviour. We tested this model in a simulated historical case from the domain of air combat and evaluated three behavioural properties against these simulated runs. The conclusion is that the model captures aspects of surprised behaviour and thus can help make agents behave more realistic in surprising situations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

The consequence of not addressing this problem, or not addressing it as effectively as hostile forces do, is a potential loss of assets, personnel, or tactical advantage. To design effective information displays there needs to be an extensible framework that models the warfighters context including characteristics of the information sources being displayed, the current Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) picture or Common Operating Picture (COP), the warfighters current state and task, and the state of the information display. BINAH (Battlespace Information and Notification through Adaptive Heuristics) uses an agent-based modeling approach coupled with research into temporal and spatial reasoning, novel display management techniques, and development of a formal high-level language for describing model-based information configuration. The result is an information configuration pipeline designed to provide perceptual and cognitive analysis support to Air Force analysts engaged in Time-Critical Targeting target nomination. It has been integrated with the Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) XML-based Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) combat information management system and combines JBI delivered sensor data with a local user model and display strategies to configure a geospatial information display. The BINAH framework will provide a firm grounding for developing new C4ISR displays that maximize the ability of warfighters to assimilate the information presented.},

The purpose of our research is to quantify the gain in mission capability as the technology attributes of the STMS are varied. We will use an agent-based model called map aware nonuniform automata (MANA) to simulate the actions of an infantry squad in a scenario. We will vary the attributes of the individual agents in MANA to represent three STMS alternatives: current soldier, the land warrior version 1.0, and objective force warrior technology. The measures of effectiveness for our experiment will be casualties over time and the time to complete the mission. Developing a model of this nature is important because it will show the benefit of new STMS alternatives and it will allow us to show a link between individual technology and mission capability. © 2003 Univesity of Virginia.},

By building a human-oriented, modular, hierarchical and multi-agent based model framework, the agent model for aircraft platform was divided into many sub-agent models which could represent the real subsystems, and the pilot agent model was represented by a hybrid structure composed of information processing, situation assessment, decisions and planning and action execution. So the behavior of the pilot agent could be modeled by employing fuzzy reasoning, dynamic Bayesian network, fuzzy Petri-net in the same framework. Finally the human-aircraft combination model was integrated into a simulation environment based on vsTASKER. The ongoing work and test results indicate that this approach is feasible. © Copyright;.},

abstract={Purpose – The primary purpose of this paper is to review and critique Taleb's notion of black swan blindness for a subset of the broader field of financial economics – the search for capital adequacy rules for financial institutions who invest in residential mortgages. This search entails the analysis and prediction of extreme events in housing and mortgage markets. Design/methodology/approach – The focus of this paper concerns efforts to assess the likelihood and consequences of extreme and consequential economic events prior to their occurrence. The goal is to assess the criticism offered by Taleb that economists overstate the understanding of extreme events. One piece of evidence consists of a case study of the literature and policies regarding capital adequacy for financial institutions who invest in residential mortgages. The other is a review of recent literature about the crisis that offers similar conclusions. Findings – The evidence suggests that the criticism is valid. The case study reviews a number of areas in which the search for capital adequacy reflected the traits of black swan blindness as described by Taleb. The review of the recent literature about the crisis highlights a number of papers that reach similar conclusions. These include high level overviews of the literature on the crisis, e.g. Lo, a number of papers that specifically focus on housing and mortgage markets, and some very recent work about agent based modeling and complexity theory presented at the 2012 ARES meetings. Research limitations/implications – The conclusion suggests a number of ways in which economists can combat the potential of black swan blindness is our search for extreme events. One suggestion is to combat the error of confirmation with ongoing testing. Combating overly simplistic narratives can also be addressed by listening more carefully to the criticisms by people outside the field. Pay more attention to silent evidence by having more substantial and ongoing consumer testing of new products, more work to identify best practices, and more resources to enforce lending laws. Finally, more attention needs to be focused upon assumptions in the models that are based upon limited empirical evidence and, if found later to be false, may lead to dire outcomes. Practical implications – These include more and ongoing evaluation of stress tests. New rules to adjust capital requirements over the business cycle are consistent with the suggestions of the paper. Economists need to spend more time exploring and learning from outliers in the models. Social implications – The recent crisis has been driven by a wide variety of factors from within many sectors and agents. The outcome has been a major problem for people in many sectors and regions of the economy. The hope is that economists can do a better job in the future to help policymakers and others be more prepared for the potential of extreme events in the hopes of avoiding them in the future or at least reducing their likelihood and damage caused by them. Originality/value – The paper draws upon a wide variety of literature to establish its main points. Central to it is a review of an issue on which the author had substantial experience – academic and professional – and that also played a major role in the crisis – inadequate capital for an extreme downturn in house prices. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

We describe the newly created agent-based software ABSNEC (Agent-Based System for Network Enabled Capabilities), highlighting some of its salient features: the ability to represent human factors towards the analysis of battle outcomes in network operations, and the ability to represent realistic force structures with tiered C2 architectures. We provide affirmative results of three validation techniques to date on the model. Finally, we demonstrate the utilization of ABSNEC to acquire meaningful insights for analysis through two examples: a study on the interrelationship between fratricide, human factors, and situation awareness; and the generation of alternative combat strategies for a military engagement. © 2012 The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.},

abstract={The dynamism and the inherent interactive nature of construction projects make them highly uncertain in nature and thus prone to unexpected events. Project level planning methods in construction assume a degree of certainty that is absent on projects. Unexpected events (such as equipment breakdown, coordination miscues, discrepancy between specs and drawings, etc.) are typically addressed by having the crew wait for a foreman or superintendent to find ways to handle the issue. This is a command and control structure that depends on a centrally controlling body. The research explores the question of whether the crew should wait for instructions or address the issue on their own. The research tests the hypothesis that a self-managed and autonomous construction crew will help combat the unexpected event more effectively than waiting for a resolution by a centrally controlling body. The two approaches are contrasted and compared for their effectiveness in dealing with unexpected events. An Agent based model shows; the delay caused by the same damage was on average 40% lower for the crew making its own decisions compared to the crew that depended on the superintendent. Considering that the model takes into account the erroneous decisions made by the crew, the prima facie result shows that allowing crews to be autonomous is an effective strategy on the long run. As a result of the crews solving problems, the superintendent is also expected to have more opportunities to concentrate on improving the coordination and planning of work on site.},

It is being developed to study the effects of quality and timeliness of C4ISR on battle operations. Recently, the networking backbone of the model was added, allowing users to quickly configure any network topology and create flexible extensions in Delphi that will allow the user to dynamically alter link capacities and packet routing. Moreover, software extensions can be used to control tracked quantities within each agent. We demonstrate these capabilities with two scenarios.},

abstract={This tutorial introduces concepts for modeling small unit combat as complex adaptive systems (CAS). It begins with a "human-centric" view of the individual combatant and small unit operations, which incorporates the concept of the individual as an integrated weapon system, the Warrior System. It addresses representation of situation awareness/situation understanding (SA/SU), and "soft" factors - morale, leadership, training, nationality/ethnicity, through agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM supports exploration of SA/SU by allowing each agent an idiosyncratic, perception-based view of the environment, rather than the simulation "god's eye" view of ground truth. Using ABM further supports the view of small unit operations as CAS - dynamically interacting open systems, characterized by "emergence", with non-linear and chaotic behaviors. A critical problem for Warrior Systems analysis is the lack of engineering models of complex integrated systems. ABM/CAS addresses this lack by "growing" or "evolving" engineering models of systems whose complexity resists traditional reductionist approaches. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The new US administration has begun efforts to securitize the substantial problems the United States is currently facing in cyberspace. Recently, President Obama ordered his National Security Council to conduct a rapid review of existing measures being undertaken by the federal government, and provide recommendations for additional ones. Many stakeholders in the US government and private industry are watching these actions closely as there seems to be broad acceptance that the issues call for more extensive security measures. However, many issues will complicate effective securitization of threats in cyberspace. For example, not all stakeholders agree on the priorities or where the focus of security measures should be yet cyber security is a "trans-sovereign" issue affecting both developed and developing countries in an interdependent manner. Because actors in cyberspace enjoy relative anonymity and can threaten interconnected targets around the globe, there is considerable debate as to whether the concept of borders is relevant to the challenges of cyber security. Regardless the focus of the debate, the concept of borders is important because they define the territory in which national governments can employ sovereign measures. To analyze borders in the context of cyber security, this paper asks the question, "Is there an important role for the concept of borders, if not physical lines, in improving national security in cyberspace?" To explore the question, the paper takes two approaches. The first is a comparison of the cyber security issues to international drug trafficking in an effort to explore how sovereign measures used to combat drug trafficking may be applicable to improving cyber security. The second approach is an examination of the issue from the perspective of the Heal and Kunreuther Inter-Dependent Security Model with an attempt to inform the cyber security decision process of national governments as they consider options to invest in a higher level of security. The paper will argue that, whether the problem is addressed from the standpoint of criminal behavior like drug trafficking, or cyber attacks in an interdependent, global domain, borders can be a potentially useful construct to address cyber security issues and inform national policy decisions, regardless of the physical location of relevant nodes. However, sovereign powers must be careful not to use the concepts of borders to curtail the progress our nations have made to connect and better the world via this evolving and expanding environment. © 2009 The authors.},

abstract={Abstract: Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a stalk borer pest plaguing the sugar producing industry in South Africa. The pest feeds on the internal tissue of sugarcane stalks, causing yield losses in sucrose. Various control methods have been proposed in an attempt to suppress the pest. These control methods are, however, often difficult and costly to test, implement, and develop further in an iterative manner. In an attempt to better understand the behavior and population dynamics of E. saccharina, an agent-based simulation model is presented in this paper which simulates the stalk borer's biology, feeding habits, mating behavior, dispersal patterns, and various other characteristics as accurately as possible. The flexibility and validity of the model are then ascertained by subjecting the model to expert opinion and parameter variation analysis. A simplified control measure is then implemented in order to demonstrate the possibility for using the agent-based model in the future for developing and testing integrated pest management strategies against E. saccharina. Recommendations for Resource Managers: The use of agent-based simulation modeling is investigated as a possible means for accurate capturing of the behavior of E. saccharina. The ability to accurately recreate pest behavior poses the opportunity for the detailed testing and development of control strategies to combat this sugarcane pest. By employing simulation modeling, control strategies may be tested to assess their anticipated success in eradicating the pest. The speed with which long-term analyses may be conducted, as well as the absence of the associated cost of infield testing, means that various scenarios may be investigated over a number of iterations in an attempt to optimize the process and achieve maximum confidence prior to infield implementation of the control strategies. The successful implementation of this science may provide a platform to extend this type of modeling to include other pests and/or plant hosts which may benefit from pest suppression.

abstract={Protection rackets cause economic and social damage across the world. States typically combat protection rackets using legal strategies that target the racketeers with legislation, strong sentencing, and increasing the presence and involvement of police officers. Nongovernmental organizations, conversely, focus on the rest of the population and counter protection rackets using a social approach. These organisations attempt to change the actions and social norms of community members with education, promotional campaigns, and discussions. We use an agent-based model, which draws on established theories of protection rackets and combines features of sociological and economic perspectives to modelling social interactions, to test the effects of legal and social approaches. We find that a legal approach is a necessary component of a policy approach, that social only approaches should not be used because they lead to large increases in violence, and that a combination of the two works best, although even this must be used carefully.

abstract={In most developing countries, over-aged vehicles play a significant role in energy demand and air pollution, which make the transportation sector a suitable choice for investigating opportunities to mitigate climate change. Apparently, people heterogeneity, social influence, and network configuration affect diffusion of innovation. This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the rational decision-making, psychological behavior, and social interaction of people to explore their reaction to policy scenarios toward adopting technological changes over time. The aim of model is to assist policymakers for energy and environmental policy design based on consumers’ behavior. The jeepney owners in the old public utility jeepney (PUJ) fleet in Metro Manila are chosen as case study to prove the applicability of the model. The results show that rational, psychological, and social interaction of owners could not lead to diffusion of technology without intervention of policy instruments. However, by implementing incentive-based policies, the entire jeepney fleet could be renovated before the end of simulation horizon and the government could launch a 5-year plan to combat pollution of the fleet. The model could be applied to evaluate and prioritize strategies for reducing the future energy requirements and emissions in other fleets and regions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Dengue is a febrile disease whose main vector transmitter is the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. This disease has an annual register of 50 million infections worldwide. Simulations are an important tool in helping to combat and prevent the epidemic and, consequently, save lives and resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Agent-Based Model for assessment of the pupal productivity of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. In this model, the reproduction of the mosquito takes into account the productivity of each type of container. The preliminary results show the effects of considering the pupal productivity for the control and prevention of dengue. As a result, we observed that the prevention methods must consider pupal productivity and that the distance between containers might leverage productivity and increase transmission risk. We verify the completeness and functionality of the model through experimentation using Netlogo. © 2015 IEEE.},

For the capability to be effective, they need to know how the attack process works, what resources are required, what doctrine should be followed, and how to command, control, and govern such integrated operations. Simulation is a powerful technology for gaining understanding about these issues. While the general principles and techniques for developing and employing simulations are well known, their application to professional offensive cyber operations is new. The purpose of this paper is to present a preliminary requirements specification for a new, agent-based simulator capable of modelling professional offensive cyber operations in a networked environment. Because attack may be the best means for defence, simulation encompasses the adversarial interaction between attacker(s) and defender(s). The requirements cover the applications-independent simulation infrastructure, touching on time handling, stochastic behaviour, the modelling representation, interfacing, and simulation control, and the cyber operations application. Cyber-specific use cases are grouped by stakeholder and phase of operation.},

abstract={Numerous mathematical and computer models were used to simulate a situation on a battlefield. We introduce Petro, a new agent-based model of historical warfare, designed to maintain a structure of command between a regiment and its soldiers. It can model various tactics of different kinds of military forces and is simple enough to build massive simulations. We use the model to simulate the warfare of 17th century Europe. Paper presents modeling of various types of military forces - Tatar riders, line infantry, hussars and reiters. We show how general patterns of combat are the result of basic rules directing the behavior of soldier and regiment agents. Finally, we use modeled troops to simulate the Battle of Kokenhausen (1601), waged between armies of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Sweden. After producing results very close to historical data, alternative scenario of the battle is considered. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Excessive absenteeism on construction projects can affect project performance in many adverse ways. Traditionally, to combat absenteeism, construction managers have used formal controls (e.g., penalties); however, these approaches frequently have proved ineffective at eliciting desired changes in workers attendance motivation. Therefore, researchers have begun modeling how social controls can be exploited to achieve organizational objectives. In this paper, we developed an agent-based model to investigate how project structure affects the spread of social norms related to absenteeism on construction projects, which in turn affects the net absence rate. Three experiments were conducted testing the effect of three different project structures (no worker turnover, modest worker turnover, and high worker turnover) in scenarios of moderate (0-5%), moderately high (5-10%), and high (10-15%) initial worker absence rates. Results indicate that the diffusion of project culture on construction sites both can benefit and harm absence rates. With mild absenteeism, more stable project structures aid in the spread of negative culture and worsen the absence rate. Alternatively, with excessive initial absenteeism, more stable project structures help diffuse positive absence culture. Understanding that social norm diffusion can create positive or negative feedback loops, construction managers can take advantage of this to help achieve administrative objectives. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Agent based models are powerful tools in describing processes and systems centered on individual behaviors and local interactions. Current application areas tend to be focused within the business and social science arenas, although their usefulness has been demonstrated in the modeling of various chemistry and physics-based systems and more recently, in unit-level military combat operations. Conversely, many highly process-oriented systems, such as manufacturing environments, tend to be modeled via "top-down" methods, including discrete or continuous event simulations. As a result, potentially critical attributes of the modeled entities or resources (spatial properties or adaptability) may not be adequately captured or developed. This research develops an agent based model for application to a problem hereto-fore addressed solely via discrete event simulation or stochastic mathematical models. Specifically, a model is constructed to investigate the effects of differing levels of maintenance manning on sortie production capability, while examining those effects on the resulting Combat Mission Readiness (CMR) of a typical F-16 squadron. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Insurgents have effectively employed asymmetric tactics, such as suicide bombers, as viable threats in urban environments. These threats are hard to detect and have proven difficult to thwart or defeat. The political, cultural, and physical environments in which they are implemented are not as readily constrainable as they are in full combat operations. Moreover, our limited understanding of human behaviors that drive the insurgent's planning, actions, and reactions, and the insurgent's ability to capitalize on the nature of the urban environment in Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) Operations adds to the complexity and challenges of detecting and defeating this threat. There is a need to increase our understanding of the decision making processes of threats in the larger context of the physical and cultural environment so that we can provide a means to identify threats by evoking responses or producing recognizable patterns such that we begin to shift the advantage in this contemporary operational environment in our favor. Previous research explored the feasibility of using agent based modeling environments to study these issues. Our current research extends this work, applying agent based modeling and simulation, extensions of electromagnetic field theory, and experimental design techniques to study these issue. This paper will discuss insights into insurgent decisioning given different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), particularly those associated with traffic flow/traffic control point (TCP) strategies, employed by counterinsurgents with the goal of shaping insurgent behaviors to make detecting them or defeating them more likely.},

abstract={Analysis of a combat campaign using game theory is difficult due to non-linearities and other soft factors which exist in a complex system. However, game theory can give decision makers insight into strategies and outcomes that can be utilized to maximize one's objective. Agent-based simulation provides the means to model complex systems with non-linearities, by allowing for interactions among independent "agents." This paper presents an agent-based model of the Allied search for U-boats in the Bay of Biscay during World War II (WWII). This model is then used to investigate game-theoretic strategies in combat using agent-based simulation. Results of pure strategies as well as adaptive strategies are presented and compared to the historical results recorded on the Bay of Biscay U-Boat war experience.},

abstract={Project Albert is an initiative of the US Marine Corps which uses a series of new models and tools, multidisciplinary teams, and the scientific method to explore questions of interest to military planners. Project Albert attempts to address key areas that traditional modeling and simulation techniques often do not capture satisfactorily and uses two data management concepts, data farming and data mining, to assist in identifying areas of interest. The current suite of models used by Project Albert includes four agent-based models that allow agents to interact with each other and produce emergent behaviors. The 4th International Project Albert Workshop was held 6-9 August 2001 in Australia. Workshop participants split into five groups, each of which attempted to apply various combinations of the Project Albert models to answer a series of questions in five areas: Control Operations; Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Intelligence Force Mix; Precision Maneuver; Mission Area Analysis; and Peace Support Operations. This paper focuses on the methodology used during the workshop, the results of the workshop, and a summary of follow-on work since the workshop. © 2002 SPIE · 0277-786X/02/$15.00.},

abstract={The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine used by many bacteria to drive a toxin-laden needle into other bacterial cells. Although the potential to influence bacterial competition is clear, the fitness impacts of wielding a T6SS are not well understood. Here we present a new agent-based model that enables detailed study of the evolutionary costs and benefits of T6SS weaponry during competition with other bacteria. Our model identifies a key problem with the T6SS. Because of its short range, T6SS activity becomes self-limiting, as dead cells accumulate in its way, forming "corpse barriers" that block further attacks. However, further exploration with the model presented a solution to this problem: if injected toxins can quickly lyse target cells in addition to killing them, the T6SS becomes a more effective weapon. We tested this prediction with single-cell analysis of combat between T6SS-wielding Acinetobacter baylyi and T6SS-sensitive Escherichia coli. As predicted, delivery of lytic toxins is highly effective, whereas nonlytic toxins leave large patches of E. coli alive. We then analyzed hundreds of bacterial species using published genomic data, which suggest that the great majority of T6SS-wielding species do indeed use lytic toxins, indicative of a general principle underlying weapon evolution. Our work suggests that, in the T6SS, bacteria have evolved a disintegration weapon whose effectiveness often rests upon the ability to break up competitors. Understanding the evolutionary function of bacterial weapons can help in the design of probiotics that can both establish well and eliminate problem species. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

abstract={To study the influence of airborne laser weapon system to bomber mission effectiveness, a capability based on the modularized simulation system is proposed. An Agent-based modeling and simulation method is used. A capability based modularized simulation system is proposed based on five agent capabilities: sensing, communication, decision, movement and execution. The state machines of airborne laser weapon system, radar system and missile system are designed within this structure. In order to analyze the dynamic change of combat effectiveness, the mathematical models proposed are related to target positions. Then, a simulation of typical penetration operation is conducted to analyze the influence of mirror diameter and initial power of airborne laser weapon system. Finally, the influence of aircraft capability on airborne laser weapon system is analyzed through a simulation with low-speed low-radar cross section (RCS) aircraft and high-speed high-RCS aircraft. The results show that increasing the mirror diameter and initial power of airborne laser weapons can increase the combat effectiveness significantly, especially to low-speed RCS aircraft. © 2020, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

abstract={We study wireless ad-hoc networks from an agent-based perspective. In our model agents with different strategies such as being selfish, tit-for-tat or battery-based compete and cooperate. If only different levels of selfishness are allowed then being selfish is clearly the dominant strategy. However, introduction of more advanced strategies allows to some extent to combat selfishness. In particular we present a battery-based approach and a hybrid of battery-based and tit-for-tat approaches. The findings give hope that the introduction of widely available ad-hoc networks might at some point be possible. Even when users are given full control of their devices, effective strategies allow for the networks overall to be effective and feasible.

abstract={With the rapid development of high energy laser weapons (HELWs), the integration of HELW on unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) has become a hot research topic. To study the impact of HELW on UCAV mission effectiveness, this paper proposes a 4-level design framework based on the system-of-system (SoS) oriented design. To validate the framework, the impact of HELW is analyzed in four aspects: the strike capability, the stealth performance, the vulnerability, and the defense capability, where the UCAV design constrains are noted. Simulation experiments of penetration scenario are carried out using agent-based modeling and simulation. The simulation results show that the integration of HELW can increase the survivability and mission effectiveness rate (MER) of the UCAV, especially for UCAVs with high speed and stealth performance. But the MER of the UCAV does not increase with the increase of HELW output power in most cases, indicating the importance of balancing the HELW and UCAV performances in concept design. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Combat search and rescue(CSAR) is a significant part of joint combat operation. The isolated personnel in hostile territory is of great value to both sides. For the sake of extremely high cost and massive consumption of time in military exercises, virtual reality is a preferred way to conduct the experiment. Mixed reality, known as MR, allows users to interact with the virtual objects, as well as the real objects. With MR devices, commanders get a better awareness of both virtual combat and real environment. Agent-based modelling is a relatively new approach to modelling systems composed of interacting objects. By analyzing the decision-making process of agents, codes are written to drive the simulation. Finally, the whole system is applied to HoloLens to provide a holographic demonstration. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

Through an online questionnaire we measured personality traits of individuals in social networks, how they behave, and how they are connected to each other. Using this data, we developed an agent-based model of an online social network. Using our model, an average of 92% of regular news and 98% of fake news were disseminated to the whole network. Network density turned out to be more important for dissemination than the differences in personality and behavior of individuals. Thus the spread of fake news can not only be addressed by focusing on the personality of individual users and their associated behavior. Systemic approaches-integrating both human and algorithm-must be considered to effectively combat fake news. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Objective To simulate, predict and analyze the total number, spatial and temporal distribution, and proportion and composition distribution of combat casualties. Methods System dynamics was used to construct an combat process simulation and casualty prediction model. Agent-based modeling was used to import macro casualty data from the prediction model, split the casualty data and assign the combat injury information in a specific proportion. Results The casualty prediction model based on system dynamics could integrate with specific operational mission and analyze the combat influencing factors, weapon destruction performance, and level of protection in both Red and Blue sides. The casual-effect loop and the stock-flow model were constructed on combat process. The degree of damage to the target of the two sides in the battle was transformed to casualty data. We extracted the macro casualty data from the combat casualty prediction model. Through constructing the corresponding relationship between the destruction degree of operational objectives and war wound information of all kinds, we assigned and simulated the traumatic condition of each individual casualty and completed the conversion from casualty to wounded flow. Conclusion Constructed casualty prediction model based on system dynamics and the casualty generating model based on agent can scientifically calculate the spatial, temporal distribution and proportion and composition of casualties. © 2018, Second Military Medical University Press.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms will play important roles in future warfare. Given the worldwide advances in unmanned systems, UAV swarms pose an increasing threat to traditional defensive methods. This paper addresses the concept of a defensive UAV swarm launched from a sea-based platform. To simulate and analyze this this system, an agent-based model is developed, and the defense success rate (DSR) is proposed as a metric of effectiveness, which can avoid inaccuracies of evaluation in a single simulation result. Then single-factor experiments are conducted to analyze the impacts of different design factors, and some reasonable and comprehensive suggestions are provided to improve the DSR. This paper showcases the important meaning of artificial intelligence in the study of UAV swarm combat and deeply analyzes the impacts of various factors on UAV swarm defense system which can be used for future engineering designs. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={A study on the evaluation method for operational effectiveness of aircraft interception using agent based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is conducted. Considering the characteristics of interception, an agent model structure based on the information process and using the mission state machine as the core is proposed. Within the structure, the concept of information domain mapping agent is proposed. Based on this concept, the modeling method of sensor detection and tracking and a common model of radar detection and tracking are provided. Simulations and analyses of two typical interception scenarios are conducted, verifying the rationality and effectiveness of the method. The results show that modes of the influence of aircraft parameters on effectiveness are different in single aircraft combat, multiple aircraft platform-centric combat, and multiple aircraft network-centric combat. © 2018, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

abstract={Many parts of platforms are expected to be replaced by unmanned systems in modern warfare. All the assets and supporting vehicles are linked to each other with a communication network, and it is called the network-centric warfare environment. Hence, it is critical when communication failure occurs during engagement in ground battlefield because this failure will directly affect overall combat effectiveness of one's owned assets. However, research regarding communication failure issues is scarce. We herein propose a new agent-based modeling process to measure the overall combat effectiveness combined with communication success ratio, based on the terrain condition of the ground engagement. Additionally, we provide the effectiveness analysis result when a communication repeater is applied during communication failure as an alternative measure. © 2018 Jaeyeong Lee et al.},

abstract={Littoral combat is a critical component of naval warfare that has gained importance since the late 20th century due to a shift from matched blue-water combat to agile, asymmetric warfare near the coast. With the increased relevance of this type of naval combat, the ability of a networked naval warfare System-of-Systems (SoS) to operate effectively given the challenges of operations in the littoral zone becomes imperative. Resilience in an SoS in the face of a variety of threats is vital. These threats may take various forms: traditional warfare, cyber attacks, or communications breakdowns. The challenge for any SoS practitioner is identifying such architectures from a vast design space. We define an architecture as the constituent systems in the SoS and the connections among these systems. We seek to apply an agent-based modeling approach to create an architecture evaluation tool that leverages the modular nature of an SoS to quickly conduct trade studies and analyses to identify architectures that are resilient to a variety of threats. The simulation tool is built on the principles of the Open Systems Architecture put forth by the Department of Defense (DoD). We present an analysis that seeks to find a suitable SoS architecture configuration that maintains operability and performance during the loss of command authorities. This loss can be attributed to battle casualties or other forms of threats including communications failures. We demonstrate that distributing managerial control in the architecture improves, to some extent, SoS performance in terms of time to threat elimination. This single analysis demonstrates how SoS practitioners can use agent-based models to quickly construct and evaluate potential architectures against a variety of threats and disruptions, ultimately building resilient SoS architectures that perform to prescribed levels even in the face of network failures and attacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Combat simulations and wargames form part of a suite of tools used to analyse complex military problems. The fidelity of this suite of tools varies in terms of their representation of both physical parameters and military doctrine. Higher fidelity models often have associated resource and computational constraints which makes exploring large regions of the parameter space infeasible. An approach known as operational synthesis employs low fidelity agent based distillation (ABD) models to rapidly search this parameter space in order to identify areas of interest for further exploration in higher fidelity models. In this study we use the Map Aware Non-Uniform Automata (MANA) ABD model to gather additional insights for a reconnaissance study that was conducted in a higher fidelity combat simulation known as COMBATXXI (CXXI). The CXXI study investigated the potential impact of variations to platform mobility, sensors and signatures on the effectiveness of land combat vehicles conducting an observation task against an airfield and a river crossing point. An existing MANA scenario was used to explore the impact of factors not considered in the CXXI study, specifically, variations to both observation post placements and schemes of manoeuvre. The MANA model identified the same trends in relation to mobility and signature that were identified in the CXXI study. The results from the additional variations performed in the MANA model showed a significant difference in the number of observations when a more aggressive and direct scheme of manoeuvre was employed and where alternative observation post locations were used. We explore these results further by implementing them in CXXI in order to provide greater confidence in the findings and further insights into the magnitude of the differences. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

abstract={For more than a decade, the military has looked for ways to improve situation awareness and situation understanding (SA/SU) at all levels of combat, from the individual to theater command. An acknowledged aspect of problems with imperfect SA/SU is how to deal with an incorrect initial view of the tactical situation and how to deal the propagation of errors based on such initial misperceptions. The authors have sought to address this problem by developing a simulation, MOdeling Being Intelligent and Lost (MOBIL), in which intelligent agents attempt to navigate an arc node graph based on a distorted view of that map. This goal of this simulation is to support investigation and assessment of the consequences of imperfect SA/SU, which requires exploring how to recognize and correct such SA/SU based on information that is uncertain, imprecise, or just plain wrong. We present a brief overview of MOBIL, concentrating on how to describe and modify an entity's perceived view of reality.},

abstract={In the past, command and control (C2) was not a modelling feature but was considered a role that human should take on. Today, however, modelling C2 becomes one of essential features to be modelled in developing wargame models since needs of the C2 modelling are increased in the perspective of 1) analysing the C2 effectiveness through simulation and 2) making wargame models that achieve high fidelity. The first attempt of modelling C2 was to transfer a series of orders in a form of scripts to combat entities which have autonomous behaviour. Now, the attempt has developed to introduce the agent concept into C2 modelling. This study proposes a modelling framework to model C2 using intelligent agent in the military domain at the level of implementation. This article presents the C2 modelling methods by dividing the C2 processes into two phases: planning and execution as the military domain C2 does.},

abstract={Presented in this paper are details regarding a Complex Adaptive System-of-Systems, multi-purpose, agent-in- The-loop behavior modeling framework. A framework designed to facilitate usage of agents and automated tools in military training and research, that can either be rapidly developed or easily modified. This particular agent-based modeling effort was initiated because, to date, operator and opponent behavior models used in the current threat systems still require a significant amount of time, effort, and expertise to develop. The approach to such a versatile framework, was, and continues to be, inspired by theories of the emergent properties exhibited in complex adaptive system's behaviors, such as the syntax and semantics inherit in a succession of events, artifact-mediated indirect communication, and facilitation of shared meaning within a multi-stakeholder environment. Also of interest are agent-environment interactions and the affordances available to an agent; a theory derived from ecological psychology. This research both supports and is supported by multi-agent simulations of military operations where the agents represent logical realistic models of military operators. A method for rapid design and evaluation of agent-based models will be identified and further discussed via descriptions of two exemplar implementations in distinct large scale complex adaptive multi-stakeholder multi-component systems.

abstract={To solving the inefficiency-problem in warship combat command and control system, this paper builds multi-agent oriented system architecture. It uses CORBA to support communication among heterogeneous systems and uses UML to design system prototype. Taking our two warships chasing an enemy-warship collaboratively for example, this paper illustrates the agent-oriented modeling process, including the role model, interaction model, state model and class model. This approach is able to meet the needs of modeling the warship combat command and control system. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={MANA (Map Aware Non-uniform Automata) is an agent-based distillation modelling environment developed by the Operations Analysis group at the Defence Technology Agency in New Zealand. MANA purposefully leaves out detailed physical attributes of the entities concerned if they are expected to have little bearing on the study at hand. This allows scenarios to be run relatively quickly, over many excursions (i.e. Monte Carlo simulation), in order to uncover capabilities or tactics where Blue can achieve dominance over Red. Another key feature of agentbased models is that, although the one-to-one interaction between various agents and their environment may be quite simple, the combined effect of many agent interactions can lead to complicated group dynamics and emergent behaviour. This paper provides the reader with an understanding of the philosophy behind the design of MANA, an overview of its features and some examples of its use. Copyright© (2013) by CAL-TEK S.r.l.},

abstract={Recently, agent-based technology is actively being considered in the field of defense Modeling and Simulation (M&S). An existing defense M&S technology has limitations to modeling and simulation for complex combat system effectively. And for various weapon systems, mission effectiveness analysis also includes subjective and qualitative factors. In other words, a large number of complex weapon systems, or integration factors are modeled as a single object to perform the simulation, are highly vulnerable in terms of scalability, reusability etc. In this paper, we perform an agent-based modeling to quickly assemble and disassemble object just as you want, and ensure a seamless interface between all the objects using one of the commercial software 'AnyLogic' that includes an agent function. As a result, we will overcome limitations of existing defense M&S. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Successful counterinsurgency and development in post-war societies require an extraordinarily complex integration of military, political, and socioeconomic operations. In order to combat insurgency and stimulate growth and stabilization in regions of Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force has charged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with developing an optimal portfolio of infrastructure projects. These projects must ultimately satisfy three lines of operation: security, governance, and development. As a proof of concept, a simulation was developed that measures the quantifiable effects of various project portfolios on citizens' health in the context of Jalalabad, Afghanistan. This tool utilizes a combination of agent-based modeling and Geographic Information Systems to measure the effect of health related infrastructure projects on a local scale. After simulating sixteen portfolios of projects, we provide a recommended set of projects for completion by the Army Corps of Engineers in Jalalabad. © 2011 IEEE.},

We provide affirmative results of three validation techniques to date on the model. Finally, we demonstrate the utilization of ABSNEC to acquire meaningful insights for analysis through two examples: A study on the interrelationship between fratricide, human factors and situation awareness; and generation of alternative combat strategies for a military engagement.},

abstract={In recent years, we have witnessed the growing application of agent-based simulations in military operations research, particularly in the area of combat modeling. In this paper we present a new probabilistic combat model of a direct fire exchange between two homogeneous forces, each employ-ing a random fire tactic. This tactic emulates those typically employed in agent-based combat models. We compare our results with those of an agent-based model and show good agreement. As well, we compare our model with a Lanch- ester direct fire model, which assumes an uniform fire tactic, and discuss the differences between the models. © 2008 EUROSIS-ETI.},

abstract={Insurgents have effectively employed asymmetric tactics, such as suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (SVBIED), as viable threats in urban environments against counterinsurgent forces conducting Stability, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction (SSTR) Operations. The operational environment, to include political, military, social, and physical factors, in which they implement these tactics is not as readily constrainable as it is in full combat operations. These factors add to the complexity and challenges of detecting and defeating this threat. This paper discusses results and the insights we have gained from experiments examining traffic control point strategy characteristics and associated SVBIED path choice and mission outcome and application of these insights in designing experiments to investigate area coverage strategies in light of insurgent capabilities and behaviors. Agent based modeling and simulation environments are used in this work for exploratory modeling across a wide range of parameters. The research extends previous work by incorporating denser and more complex urban settings, traffic, and strategy factors that can affect the decisioning of the threat. Moreover, in previous efforts, the traffic control points (TCPs) were arrayed around a single target in a point type of defense. In this set of experiments we move to multiple possible targets and an area defense. Our goal is to generate insights that will allow counterinsurgent forces to implement strategies robust against a range of SVBIED behaviors.},

abstract={The Bradley Fighting Vehicle System entered into Army service in 1981 and will be used in the Army inventory until at least the year 2032. In order to maintain lethal dominance, the Bradley will require a new direct fire systems. Larger caliber systems provide increased lethality, but reduce the amount of ammunition available and have increased cost. This project investigated which alternative provides the optimum Bradley weapons system. The client was interested in the weapon performance over a variety of terrains and mission profiles. In order to reduce the number of combinations of design variables, Pythagoras, an Agent-Based Model, was employed to investigate the optimum burst size for each weapon. Then a high resolution combat model, JCATS, will be employed to examine the performance of the candidate systems as compared to the current system. A value model was developed to compare the evaluation measures.},
