abstract={Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Environmental Restoration (ER) Department has developed a steady-state two-dimensional (2D) flow model and transient 3-dimensional (3D) flow model to support risk assessment and solute-transport modelling. The 2D model was based upon steady-state inverse flow modelling to grossly estimate transmissivity and recharge within the Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB) region. Based upon the results of the 2D model, we modified the regional-scale Albuquerque Basin Model (ABM) to set flux boundaries for the sub-regional-scale 3D model. The 2D inverse approach enabled us to focus on inadequacies of the conceptual model design and the 3D model was used to analyse dynamic flow conditions more rigorously on KAFB.},

abstract={This article proposes a multi-agent approach to modelling the genesis of alluvial sediments. The aim is to generate a set of sedimentary structures such as channels, point-bars and oxbow lakes by means of sedimentary process simulations. These structures will later be used to study groundwater flow. The major deposition-erosion processes are represented in an approximate and stochastic manner. The behaviour of sedimentary entities is defined by empirical rules derived from the local geometry of the flume. The emphasis of this paper is on the capacity of the model to reproduce stream evolution. The model was tested on the West Fork White River (Indiana), and shows the main trend in the evolution of a meandering system despite the simplicity of imposed rules. Expected future developments of this approach are outlined.},

abstract={A numerical model presented here develops a three-dimensional image of alluvial media on an elementary scale significant for groundwater flow modelling. The model was tested on the alluvial plain of the Rhône River (France), on a scale of several kilometres and, from geomorphological observations and dating, reproduced the construction of this alluvial plain from ≈ 15 000 years BP to the present. The history of the alluvial plain during the Late Glacial and Holocene periods is summarized. Through most of this time, the River Rhône has maintained a braided pattern, with the exception of two incising phases with a meander pattern. The model does not use any physically based equations or water representation. The main processes governing the construction of the plain are modelled by simple rules chosen according to geometrical or empirical laws taken from the literature or as modelling assumptions. Using multi-agent concepts of distribution and interaction of elementary entities, these sedimentary rules are applied to 'sediment' entities or to conceptual 'erosion' entities that simulate local deposition and erosion of sediments. The sedimentation model reproduces the various climatic periods during which the sediments were deposited by simulating genetic periods and associated modelled processes. For each period, the model was constrained by quantitative field data such as altitude of ancient channels and deposits or thickness of sediments. The general geometry of the alluvial deposits was satisfactorily reproduced. During the simulation, characteristic large-scale features emerge despite the use of local rules. The model results are discussed with reference to other approaches, such as geostatistical or Boolean models, and the applicability of the model to other less documented alluvial plains is outlined.},

abstract={The research project GLOWA-Danube, financed by the German Federal Government, investigates long-term changes in the water cycle of the upper Danube river basin in light of global climatic change. Its aim is to build a fully integrated decision support tool "DANUBIA" that combines the competence of eleven institutes in domains covering all major aspects governing the water cycle. The research group "Groundwater and Water Supply" at the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering (IWS), Universitaet Stuttgart, contributes a three-dimensional groundwater flow model and a large-scale water supply model which simulate both water availability and quality and water supply and the related costs for global change scenarios. This article addresses the task of creating an agent-based model of the water supply sector. The water supply model links the various physical models determining water quality and availability on the one hand and the socalled "Actor" models calculating water demand on the other by determining the actual water supply and the costs related, which underlie both technical and physical constraints (e.g., existing infrastructure and its capacity, water availability and quality, geology, elevation, etc.). In reality, water supply within the study is organised through a three-tiered structure: long-distance, regional, and a multitude of community-based suppliers. In order to model this system in which each supply company defines its own optimum, an agent-based modelling approach (implemented using JAVA) was chosen. This approach is novel to modelling water supply in that not only water supply infrastructure but more importantly the decision makers (communities, water supply companies) are represented as generalised objects, capable of performing actions following rules that are determined by the class they belong to. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The research project GLOWA-Danube, financed by the German Federal Government, is investigating long-term changes in the water cycle of the upper Danube river basin (77,000 km2) in light of global climatic change. Its aim is to build a fully integrated decision-support tool "DANUBIA" that combines the competence of 11 different research institutes in domains covering all major aspects governing the water cycle-from the formation of clouds, to groundwater flow patterns, to the behaviour of the water consumer. Both the influence of natural changes in the ecosystem, such as climate change, and changes in human behaviour, such as changes in land use or water consumption, are considered. DANUBIA is comprised of 15 individual disciplinary models that are connected via customized interfaces that facilitate network-based parallel calculations. The strictly object-oriented DANUBIA architecture was developed using the graphical notation tool UML (Unified Modeling Language) and has been implemented in Java code. All models use the same spatial discretisation for the exchange of data (1 × 1 km grid cells) but are using different time steps. The representation of a vast number of relevant physical and social processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales is a very demanding task. Newly developed up- and downscaling procedures [Rojanschi, V., 2001. Effects of upscaling for a finite-difference flow model. Master's Thesis, Institut für Wasserbau, Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany] and a sophisticated time controller developed by the computer sciences group [Hennicker, R., Barth, M., Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2002. DANUBIA: A Web-based modelling and decision support system for integrative global change research in the upper Danube basin. In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 35-38; Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2003. GLOWA-Danube Papers Technical Release No. 002 (Danubia Framework), Software-Release No.: 0.9.2, Documentation Version: 0.10, Release Date: 27 March 2003] are required to solve the emerging problems. After a first successful public demonstration of the DANUBIA package (nine models) in May 2002 [Mauser, W., Stolz, R., Colgan, A., 2002. GLOWA-Danube: integrative techniques, scenarios and strategies regarding global change of the water cycle. In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (Phase I, 2000-2003) Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 31-34], the research consortium is now preparing a first validation run of DANUBIA for the period 1995-1999 with all 15 models. After successful completion of the validation, a scenario run based on IPCC climate scenarios [IPCC, 2001. Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report. In: Watson, R.T., Core Writing Team (Eds.), A Contribution of Working Groups I, II, and III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA, 398pp] for a five year period between 2025 and 2040 will follow at the end of 2003. The research group "Groundwater and Water Resources Management" at the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering, Universität Stuttgart, is contributing both a three-dimensional groundwater flow model of the catchment and an agent-based model for simulating water supply and distribution. This paper gives a general overview of the GLOWA-Danube project and describes the groundwater modeling segment. Nickel et al. deal with the water supply model in a second contribution to this special issue. A three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model consisting of four main layers has been developed and is in a continual state of refinement (MODFLOW, [McDonald, M.G., Harbaugh, A.W., 1988. A modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water flow model: US Geological Survey Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations, Washington, USA (book 6, Chapter A1)]). One main research focus has been on the investigation of upscaling techniques to meet the requirement of a fixed 1 × 1 km cell size. This cell size is compulsory for all models in DANUBIA in order to facilitate a one to one parameter exchange. In a second stage, a transport model (nitrogen) will be added (MT3D: [Zheng, C., Hathaway, D.-L., 1991.

abstract={Rapidly declining groundwater levels since the early 1990s have raised serious concern in Monroe County, Michigan. Hydrological studies suggest that land-use changes have caused this decline. The mechanisms linking land-use and groundwater dynamics are not clear, however. In this paper I present WULUM, the Water-Use and Land-Use Model, an agent-based model that serves as an analytical framework to understand how these processes interact to create the observed patterns of resource depletion, and to suggest policies to reverse the process. The land-use component includes the main groundwater extractors in the county - stone quarries, golf courses, farms, and households. The groundwater component includes the glacial deposits and the underlying bedrock acquifer. The behavior of water users is defined by simple rules that determine their location and consumption. The dynamics of groundwater are represented through infiltration and diffusion rules between each cell and its immediate neighbors. Initial explorations with the model showed that land-use patterns contributed significantly to groundwater declines, while eliminating quarry dewatering did not entirely solve the problem. Both low-density and high-density zoning restrictions improved aquifer conditions over medium-density development, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between intensity of residential use and groundwater levels. Moreover, of all the natural and policy variables, zoning had the greatest influence on urban settlement and therefore on resource consumption.},

abstract={Low coral islands are heavily dependent on groundwater for freshwater supplies. The declaration by the government of Kiribati of water reserves over privately owned land has led to conflicts, illegal settlements, and vandalism. Also, the water consumption tends to increase toward Western-like standards, and human pollution has already contaminated most freshwater lenses. This project aims to provide relevant information to local stakeholders to facilitate dialogue and devise sustainable water management practices. A computer-assisted role-playing game is implemented to fulfill this aim. The following three-stage methodology is applied: collecting local and expert knowledge, blending the di ferent viewpoints into a game-based model, and playing the game with the di ferent stakeholders to explore di ferent scenarios. Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage of the project is characterized by the upheaval of contradictory government stands that undermine the whole process. It is argued that heterogeneous viewpoints may be handled in a satisfactory manner during the gaming sessions but that long-term hidden agendas may override the outcomes. Beyond the inherent question of legitimacy attached to such approaches, some players clearly must deal with constraints that are often genuinely considered external to the ongoing negotiation process. © SAGE Publications, Inc. 2007.},

abstract={Environmental degradation is often defined as a public goods problem, emerging when property rights are not clearly defined and costs are externalized to other parties. Proposing corrective regulation that enforces technological fixes or market-based approaches is often met with political resistance and doubts about its effectiveness. This is partly due to the complexity of interacting physical and socio-economic components that obscure the impacts of human decision-making on environmental functions. Yet, understanding the complexity of integrated human-environmental systems can help planners and stakeholders frame environmental problems, view their role in them and design effective policies to address them. This article examines the potential and limitations of agent-based models as metaphors that can contribute to the understanding of such complex systems, illustrating the argument with a hypothetical application in groundwater management.},

abstract={Subsistence farming communities are dependent on the landscape to provide the resource base upon which their societies can be built. A key component of this is the role of climate and the feedback between rainfall, crop growth, land clearance and their coupling to the hydrological cycle. Temporal fluctuations in rainfall alter the spatial distribution of water availability, which in turn is mediated by soil-type, slope and landcover. This pattern ultimately determines the locations within the landscape that can support agriculture and controls sustainability of farming practices. The representation of such a system requires us to couple together the dynamics of human and ecological systems and landscape change, each of which constitutes a significant modelling challenge on its own. Here we present a proto-type coupled modelling system to simulate land-use change by bringing together three simple process models: (a) an agent-based model of subsistence farming; (b) an individual-based model of forest dynamics; and (c) a spatially explicit hydrological model which predicts distributed soil moisture and basin scale water fluxes. Using this modelling system we investigate how demographic changes influence deforestation and assess its impact on forest ecology, stream hydrology and changes in water availability. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The seasonal nature of Australia's tropical rivers means that connected groundwater aquifers are an important source of both consumptive and non-consumptive water, particularly during the dry season. The management of these common pool groundwater resources is one of the predominant water issues facing northern Australia. A national program of water reform stipulates the expansion of water trading as a key instrument for water allocation. The effectiveness of new institutional arrangements such as water markets will be determined mostly by how well they coordinate with local environmental requirements, local institutions and local norms. This paper describes a novel application of combined field work, institutional analysis, experimental economics and agent-based modeling to the analysis of a potential water market in the Katherine region of the Northern Territory, Australia. The effectiveness of different versions of the policy instrument is assessed in light of local conditions. Instruments that enable personal relationships and local institutions and norms to play a role in water management are found to be more effective in terms of both farming income and environmental impact. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract={The U.S. Geological Survey numerical groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, was integrated with an agent-based land-use model to yield a simulator for environmental planning studies. Ultimately, this integrated simulator will be used as a means to organize information, illustrate potential system responses, and facilitate communication within a participatory modeling framework. Initial results show the potential system response to different zoning policy scenarios in terms of the spatial patterns of development, which is referred to as urban form, and consequent impacts on groundwater levels. These results illustrate how the integrated simulator is capable of representing the complexity of the system. From a groundwater modeling perspective, the most important aspect of the integration is that the simulator generates stresses on the groundwater system within the simulation in contrast to the traditional approach that requires the user to specify the stresses through time.

abstract={The environmental planning literature proposes a set of "best management practices" for urban development that assumes improvement in environmental quality as a result of specific urban patterns. Recent work questions this assumption, showing the need to qualify such statements with considerations of physical and ecological context, temporal and spatial scale, and interactions and processes. We explore the benefits and drawbacks of different degrees of model coupling to examine this complexity, and use the integration of an agent-based model of land-use change and a groundwater flow numerical model as an illustration. Model integration allowed us to examine the multi-dimensional effects of land-use patterns and extract useful policy implications. Nevertheless, uncoupled models provide useful approximations to integration, as well as a reference to evaluate the outputs of other forms of modeling.},

abstract={Viewing an urban water system as a complex adaptive system provides new opportunities for analysis and avoids some critical simplifications. Taking this perspective, it is possible to explore the inter-related effects of changes to the system. This is particularly important in the developing world where donors providing aid aim to improve conditions but struggle to understand and quantify the systemic impacts of their actions. This is because an intervention aiming to improve condition may also have unintended and undesirable effects. To provide decision support, this paper describes an agent-based model of an urban water system, developed on the basis of ethnographic interviews, and subsequently evaluated by local stakeholders. The paper describes the model design as well as the results of scenarios. The model provides guidance on which system amendments may produce the best outcomes in terms of output variables, and on the basis of sense-checking and sensitivity analysis it is judged that model results are likely to give a good indication about possible real world outcomes. It is clear that no single strategy will solve all problems on its own, but that a combined strategy - with a strong focus on groundwater management and protection - is likely to be most successful. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Irrigated agriculture is a main user of groundwater. Achieving a sustainable use of groundwater will often require agricultural land-use changes such as shifting to entirely different kinds of crops and/or technologies. Enhanced understanding of land-use change is hence required for developing policies for a sustainable water future. We use an agent-based model to investigate the history of irrigated agriculture in the Upper Guadiana Basin, Spain, in order to learn about the influence of farmers' characteristics on land-use change and associated groundwater over-use. A shift from vineyards and cereals to horticultural crops would provide a possibility for higher income with less water use. Such a shift cannot be observed historically. The model results suggest that risk aversion and path dependency are insufficient to explain this observation, and the organisational set-up of farms limiting the maximum labour force needs to be considered as additional explanatory factor. Furthermore, it is shown that different types of farms existing in the UGB can be expected to exhibit distinct responses to drivers of land-use change such as agricultural policies. It is concluded that a sound understanding of the social system making use of a resource is required to solve problems of resource over-use. This article demonstrates that agent-based models can be useful tools to enhance such an understanding even in situations of scarce and uncertain data that are often encountered when dealing with resource-use problems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Based on coal mine hydrogeological conditions, the causes and evolution mechanism of coal mine water hazards were presented. By using complex systems theory and multi-agent modeling method, an evolutionary model of coal mine water hazards was developed. Then simulated the evolution process with different system conditions by Netlogo platform, and the coal mine water hazards process and vulnerability relationship were demonstration dynamical. The research shows that, the coal mine water hazards, influenced by multiple factors, is a complex and adaptive phenomenon that possesses nonlinear dynamic characteristics. Only by understanding the mine hydrogeological conditions, use complex systems theory and multi-agent modeling method, the mechanism of coal mine water hazards can be uncovered in nature.},

These best management practices, however, often do not recognise finite biophysical limits and social impacts that urban patterns alone cannot overcome. To shed light on this debate, we explore the effects of different degrees of urban clustering on groundwater levels using a coupled land-use change and groundwater-flow model. Our simulations show that specific urban forms only slow down the impact on groundwater. As population increases, the pattern in which it is accommodated ceases to matter, and widespread depletion ensues. These results are predictable, yet current planning practice tends to take growth for granted and is reluctant to envision either no-growth scenarios or the prospect of depletion. We propose to use simulations such as those presented here to aid in policy discussions that allow decision makers to question the assumption of sustainable growth and suggest alternative forms of development. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={County and regional government agencies use stakeholder committees to ensure representation of diverse interests when planning, but these representatives often are not trained to understand the complexity inherent to human-environmental issues (e.g., groundwater management). Planning professionals use computer models to simulate the interaction effects of different planrelated policies, but most are "black boxes" to stakeholders, who, therefore, are forced to trust the simulations without understanding human-environmental complexity, reducing the opportunities for effective solution building. Agent-based models can represent decisions and environmental dynamics in a rule-based form that invites nonexpert users' involvement in both developing the model and meaningfully interpreting its outputs. We conducted a series of collaborative and developmental agent-based modeling meetings with stakeholders and planners in a rapidly suburbanizing area facing groundwater shortages. Stakeholders learned how to use the models, understand the relationships among the components, interpret the outputs based on these relationships, and suggested modifications with new insights. The enhanced understanding of complex interactions reduced early commitments to policy solutions as stakeholders jointly explored the range of possible outcomes. These results show that agent-based modeling holds promise for use in collaborative planning exercises.},

abstract={Australian governments have set an ambitious policy agenda for reform. By 2010, water plans were to have provided for the return of all overallocated or overused systems to environmentally sustainable levels of extraction, however, many communities do not yet have full confidence in water plans or their processes. In two national research projects we developed practical tools for transparent and engaging processes to build confidence in water planning. We observe that inherent politicised risks in water planning mean that current methods of public participation, such as information giving and allowing written submissions, are 'safer' and more easily managed. The next article in this special issue sets out the methodology including performance indicators for the tools that we used in the research. To demonstrate their role in building community confidence using best available science we trialled tools which included agent-based participatory modelling, deliberative multi-criteria evaluation, social impact assessment, and groundwater visualisation models. The suite of 'good-practice' tools, including Indigenous engagement, is fully described in the following articles of this special issue. Evaluations show deliberative processes have much to offer when applied to questions that have been developed collaboratively and formulated carefully to allow implementation of findings. Interactive tools and those which have high visual impact are consistently rated highly by all sectors of the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and also by water planners. These results have implications for water planning internationally especially where science is contested, social values are uncertain, and communities are diverse. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Bentonites are candidate materials for the encapsulation of radioactive waste. In the 'Alternative Buffer Material test' (ABM), compacted ring-shaped blocks of eleven different buffer materials (mainly bentonites) were packed vertically on top of each other with an iron tube as heater in the centre. These buffer materials started with various exchangeable cation populations (EC population). The first 'ABM package' was terminated 28 months after installation and the bentonites had been exposed to the maximum temperature (130°C) for about one year. The aim of the present study is first: to describe modification of the cation exchange population, and second to understand the influence of the groundwater on cation exchange at different scales. No significant horizontal variation of any exchangeable cation (EC) was detected between 1 and 7 cm distance from contact with the iron tube. Large total differences of the ECpopulations, however, were observed for the individual blocks after the field experiment (n = 21 blocks) with respect to the composition of the reference materials. The average cation exchange capacity (CEC) values of the analysed bentonites (n = 9 blocks) decreased by 5.5 meq/100 (1.1-8.8 meq/100 g) after the experiment. Exchangeable Na+ and Mg2+ decreased on average, whereas Ca2+ increased. This trend was pronounced in the top region of the parcel (upper seven blocks). Although most changes occurred on the large scale of the whole test parcel, small but important changes were also recorded in the vertical direction on the centimetre scale. The observed differences cannot be explained assuming simply that a bentonite reacts only with neighbouring blocks, which would mean that the system was more or less closed. The differences are much larger and the only conclusion from this observation is that the whole package seems to be influenced by the groundwater which was added from a water tank at the experiment site, enabling at least partial equilibration between the different blocks. © 2013 Mineralogical Society.},

abstract={In Korea, the heavy metal pollution from about 1,000 abandoned mines has been a serious environmental issue. Especially, the surface waters, groundwaters, and soils around mines have been contaminated by heavy metals originating from acid mine drainage (AMD) and mine tailings. So far, AMD was considered as a waste stream to be treated to prevent environmental pollutions; however, the stream contains mainly Fe and Al and valuable metals such as Ni, Zn, and Cu. In this study, Visual MINTEQ simulation was carried out to investigate the speciation of heavy metals as functions of pH and neutralizing agents. Based on the simulation, selective pH values were determined to form hydroxide or carbonate precipitates of Cu, Zn, and Ni. Experiments based on the simulation results show that the recovery yield of Zn and Cu were 91 and 94 %, respectively, in a binary mixture of Cu and Zn, while 95 % of Cu and 94 % of Ni were recovered in a binary mixture of Cu and Ni. However, the recovery yield and purity of Zn and Ni were very low because of similar characteristics of Zn and Ni. Therefore, the mixture of Cu and Zn or Cu and Ni could be recovered by selective precipitation via pH adjustment; however, it is impossible to recover selectively Zn and Ni in the mixture of them. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This study explores groundwater management policies and the effect of modeling assumptions on the projected performance of those policies. The study compares an optimal economic allocation for groundwater use subject to streamflow constraints, achieved by a central planner with perfect foresight, with a uniform tax on groundwater use and a uniform quota on groundwater use. The policies are compared with two modeling approaches, the Optimal Control Model (OCM) and the Multi-Agent System Simulation (MASS). The economic decision models are coupled with a physically based representation of the aquifer using a calibrated MODFLOW groundwater model. The results indicate that uniformly applied policies perform poorly when simulated with more realistic, heterogeneous, myopic, and self-interested agents. In particular, the effects of the physical heterogeneity of the basin and the agents undercut the perceived benefits of policy instruments assessed with simple, single-cell groundwater modeling. This study demonstrates the results of coupling realistic hydrogeology and human behavior models to assess groundwater management policies. The Republican River Basin, which overlies a portion of the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study for this analysis. Key Points Detailed physical model was necessary to properly investigate policy instruments Agent heterogeneity significantly affects policy instrument effectiveness Both policy instruments benefit from a weighted system or an adaptive system © 2014.

abstract={Planners making groundwater plans often use scientific hydrological forecasts to estimate long term the risk of water depletion. We study a group of Chicago planners and stakeholders who learned to use and helped develop agent-based models (ABM) of coupled land-use change and groundwater flow, to explore the effects of resource use and policy on future groundwater availability. Using discourse analysis, we found planners learned to play with the ABM to judge complex interaction effects. The simulation results challenged prior policy commitments, and instead of reconsidering those commitments to achieve sustainability, participants set aside the ABM and the lessons learned with them. Visualizing patterns of objections and agreements in the dialogue enabled us to chart how clusters of participants gradually learned to grasp and interpret the simulated effects of individual and policy decisions even as they struggled to incorporate them into their deliberations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Context: Both global change and policy reform will affect the implementation of the National Ecological Network (NEN) in the Netherlands. Global change refers to a combination of changing groundwater tables arising from climate change and improved economic prospects for farming. Policy reform refers to the abolition of an intermediary organization that organizes land trades with the support of a national land bank. Objective: In this paper we evaluate the effects of these factors on future land acquisition for the NEN. Methods: We applied an agent-based model of the land market based on sales and purchases between farmers and nature-conservation organizations (establishing the NEN) within a case study area. Results: Our results demonstrate that future land acquisitions for the NEN are constrained by strong competition for land from farmers due to improved economic prospects for farming. Effects of climate change are that fewer parcels will be sold from farmers to nature-conservation organizations in a dry scenario as compared to a wet scenario. An important constraint for land acquisitions is the low willingness to pay (WTP) for land by nature-conservation organizations. We demonstrate that higher WTP increases land purchases considerably. However, the spatial pattern of land acquisition is fragmented, which may undermine its effectiveness from a restoration perspective. Conclusions: The combination of these processes leads to land acquisitions for the NEN that do not meet the initially-stated policy objectives by far. In addition, the abolition of a land-trade organization supported by a land bank leads to more fragmented pattern of nature reserves. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={With rivers in critical regions already exploited to capacity throughout the world and groundwater overdraft as well as large-scale contamination occurring in many areas, we have entered an era in which multiple simultaneous stresses will drive water management. Increasingly, groundwater resources are taking a more prominent role in providing freshwater supplies. We discuss the competing fresh groundwater needs for human consumption, food production, energy, and the environment, as well as physical hazards, and conflicts due to transboundary overexploitation. During the past 50 years, groundwater management modeling has focused on combining simulation with optimization methods to inspect important problems ranging from contaminant remediation to agricultural irrigation management. The compound challenges now faced by water planners require a new generation of aquifer management models that address the broad impacts of global change on aquifer storage and depletion trajectory management, land subsidence, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, seawater intrusion, anthropogenic and geogenic contamination, supply vulnerability, and long-term sustainability. The scope of research efforts is only beginning to address complex interactions using multiagent system models that are not readily formulated as optimization problems and that consider a suite of human behavioral responses. © 2015.

abstract={Interdependencies of ecologic, hydrologic, and social systems challenge traditional approaches to natural resource management in semi-arid regions. As a complex social-ecological system, water demands in the Sonoran Desert from agricultural and urban users often conflicts with water needs for its ecologically-significant riparian corridors. To explore this system, we developed an agent-based model to simulate complex feedbacks between human decisions and environmental conditions in the Rio Sonora Watershed. Cognitive mapping in conjunction with stakeholder participation produced a Bayesian model of conditional probabilities of local human decision-making processes resulting to changes in water demand. Probabilities created in the Bayesian model were incorporated into the agent-based model, so that each agent had a unique probability to make a positive decision based on its perceived environment at each point in time and space. By using a Bayesian approach, uncertainty in the human decision-making process could be incorporated. The spatially-explicit agent-based model simulated changes in depth-to-groundwater by well pumping based on an agent's water demand. Changes in depth-to-groundwater feedback to influence agent behavior, as well as determine unique vegetation classes within the riparian corridor. Each vegetation class then provides varying stakeholder-defined quality values of ecosystem services. Using this modeling approach allowed us to examine effects on both the ecological and social system of semi-arid riparian corridors under various scenarios. The insight provided by the model contributes to understanding how specific interventions may alter the complex social-ecological system in the future. © 2015 Pope and Gimblett.},

abstract={The contemporary definition of integrated water resources management (IWRM) is introduced to promote a holistic approach in water engineering practices. IWRM deals with planning, design and operation of complex systems in order to control the quantity, quality, temporal and spatial distribution of water with the main objective of meeting human and ecological needs and providing protection from water related disasters. This paper examines the existing decision making support in IWRM practice, analyses the advantages and limitations of existing tools, and, as a result, suggests a generic multi-method modeling framework that has the main goal to capture all structural complexities of, and interactions within, a water resources system. Since the traditional tools do not provide sufficient support, this framework uses multi-method simulation technique to examine the codependence between water resources system and socioeconomic environment. Designed framework consists of (i) a spatial database, (ii) a traditional process-based model to represent the physical environment and changing conditions, and (iii) an agent-based spatially explicit model of socio-economic environment. The multi-agent model provides for building virtual complex systems composed of autonomous entities, which operate on local knowledge, possess limited abilities, affect and are affected by local environment, and thus, enact the desired global system behavior. Agent-based model is used in the presented work to analyze spatial dynamics of complex physical-social-economic-biologic systems. Based on the architecture of the generic multi-method modeling framework, an operational model for the Upper Thames River basin, Southwestern Ontario, Canada, is developed in cooperation with the local conservation authority. Six different experiments are designed by combining three climate and two socio-economic scenarios to analyze spatial dynamics of a complex physical-social-economic system of the Upper Thames River basin. Obtained results show strong dependence between changes in hydrologic regime, in this case surface runoff and groundwater recharge rates, and regional socio-economic activities. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract={This paper presents and illustrates FlowLogo, an interactive modelling environment for developing coupled agent-based groundwater models (GW-ABMs). It allows users to simulate complex socio-environmental couplings in groundwater systems, and to explore how desirable patterns of groundwater and social development can emerge from agent behaviours and interactions. GW-ABMs can be developed using a single piece of software, addressing common issues around data transfer and model analyses that arise when linking ABMs to existing groundwater codes. FlowLogo is based on a 2D finite-difference solution of the governing groundwater flow equations and a set of procedures to represent the most common types of stresses and boundary conditions of regional aquifer flow. The platform is illustrated using a synthetic example of an expanding agricultural region that depends on groundwater for irrigation. The implementation and analysis of scenarios from this example highlight the possibility to: (i) deploy agents at multiple scales of decision-making (farmers, waterworks, institutions), (ii) model feedbacks between agent behaviours and groundwater dynamics, and (iii) perform sensitivity and multi-realisation analyses on social and physical factors. The FlowLogo interface allows interactively changing parameters using 'tuneable' dials, which can adjust agent decisions and policy levers during simulations. This flexibility allows for live interaction with audiences (role-plays), in participatory workshops, public meetings, and as part of learning activities in classrooms. FlowLogo's interactive features and ease of use aim to facilitate the wider dissemination and independent validation of GW-ABMs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A multi-agent system (MAS) model is coupled with a physically-based groundwater model to understand the declining water table in the heavily irrigated Republican River basin. Each agent in the MAS model is associated with five behavioral parameters, and we estimate their influences on the coupled models using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). This paper utilizes Hadoop-based Cloud Computing techniques and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) based variance decomposition approach for the improvement of GSA with large-scale socio-hydrological models. With the techniques, running 1000 scenarios of the coupled models can be completed within two hours with Hadoop clusters, a substantial improvement over the 42 days required to run these scenarios sequentially on a desktop machine. Based on the model results, GSA is conducted with the surrogate model derived from using PCE to measure the impacts of the spatio-temporal variations of the behavioral parameters on crop profits and the water table, identifying influential parameters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Conventional wisdom in many agricultural systems across the world is that farmers cannot, will not, or should not pay the full costs associated with surface water delivery. Across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, only a handful can claim complete recovery of operation, maintenance, and capital costs; across Central and South Asia, fees are lower still, with farmers in Nepal, India, and Kazakhstan paying fractions of a U.S. penny for a cubic meter of water. In Pakistan, fees amount to roughly USD 1-2 per acre per season. However, farmers in Pakistan spend orders of magnitude more for diesel fuel to pump groundwater each season, suggesting a latent willingness to spend for water that, under the right conditions, could potentially be directed toward water-use fees for surface water supply. Although overall performance could be expected to improve with greater cost recovery, asymmetric access to water in canal irrigation systems leaves the question open as to whether those benefits would be equitably shared among all farmers in the system. We develop an agent-based model (ABM) of a small irrigation command to examine efficiency and equity outcomes across a range of different cost structures for the maintenance of the system, levels of market development, and assessed water charges. We find that, robust to a range of different cost and structural conditions, increased water charges lead to gains in both efficiency and concomitant improvements in equity as investments in canal infrastructure and system maintenance improve the conveyance of water resources further down watercourses. This suggests that, under conditions in which (1) farmers are currently spending money to pump groundwater to compensate for a failing surface water system, and (2) there is the possibility that through initial investment to provide perceptibly better water supply, genuine win-win solutions can be attained through higher water-use fees to beneficiary farmers. © 2016 by the author(s).},

abstract={Modelling soluble pollutants in aquifers requires sufficient knowledge of hydrogeological processes as well as strong digital skills to use basic associated tools. These technical aspects often prevent from addressing the problem of groundwater pollution, for instance with students. In this paper, the basic necessary concepts to model the transfer of pollutants into an aquifer are summed up. The processes are then explicitly modelled with multi-agents techniques and implemented into the Netlogo open platform (Wilensky, 1999). The modelled processes are thus easy to use and to modify for educational activities but also for research with relatively simple digital experiments. © CNRS-UMR Géographie-cités 8504.},

abstract={Dynamical malaria models can relate precipitation to the availability of vector breeding sites using simple models of surface hydrology. Here, a revised scheme is developed for the VECTRI malaria model, which is evaluated alongside the default scheme using a two year simulation by HYDREMATS, a 10 metre resolution, village-scale model that explicitly simulates individual ponds. Despite the simplicity of the two VECTRI surface hydrology parametrization schemes, they can reproduce the sub-seasonal evolution of fractional water coverage. Calibration of the model parameters is required to simulate the mean pond fraction correctly. The default VECTRI model tended to overestimate water fraction in periods subject to light rainfall events and underestimate it during periods of intense rainfall. This systematic error was improved in the revised scheme by including the a parametrization for surface run-off, such that light rainfall below the initial abstraction threshold does not contribute to ponds. After calibration of the pond model, the VECTRI model was able to simulate vector densities that compared well to the detailed agent based model contained in HYDREMATS without further parameter adjustment. Substituting local rain-gauge data with satellite-retrieved precipitation gave a reasonable approximation, raising the prospects for regional malaria simulations even in data sparse regions. However, further improvements could be made if a method can be derived to calibrate the key hydrology parameters of the pond model in each grid cell location, possibly also incorporating slope and soil texture.

abstract={Comparison of the similarities and differences between terrestrial and Martian hillside gullies promotes understanding of how surface processes operate on both planets. Here we tested the viability of subsurface flow of water as a process affecting gully evolution. We compared gullies within the Monaro Volcanic Province near Cooma, New South Wales, Australia, to gullies possessing strong structural control near Gasa Crater, Noachis Terra, Mars. Although cursory examination of the Monaro gullies initially suggested strong evidence for aquifer erosion, detailed field surveys showed the evidence to be ambiguous. Instead a complex regime of erosion dependent on multiple conditions and processes such as local geology, surface runoff, dry mass wasting, and animal activity emerged. We found the morphology of gullies near Gasa Crater to be consistent with erosion caused by liquid water, while also being heavily influenced by the local environment, including slope and geology. Additionally, erosion at the Martian site was not consistent with evidence of subsequent, smaller scale erosion and channel modification by dry mass wasting. Local conditions thus play an important role in gully evolution, further highlighting that processes forming Martian gullies may be more diverse than initially thought. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Bentonite clays are regarded a promising material for engineered barrier systems for the encapsulation of hazardous wastes because of their low hydraulic permeability, swelling potential, ability to self-seal cracks in contact with water and their high sorption potential. SKB (Svensk Kärnbränslehantering) has been conducting long term field scale experiments on potential buffer materials at the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory for radioactive waste disposal in Sweden. The Alternative Buffer Material (ABM) test examined buffer properties of eleven different clay materials under the influence of groundwater and at temperatures reaching up to 135 °C, replicating the heat pulse after waste emplacement. Clay materials were emplaced into holes drilled in fractured granite as compacted rings around a central heater element and subsequently brought into contact with groundwater for 880 days. After test termination, and against expectations, all clay materials were found to have undergone large scale alterations in the cation exchange population. A reactive-diffusive transport model was developed to aid the interpretation of the observed large-scale porewater chemistry changes. It was found, that the interaction between Äspö groundwater and the clay blocks, together with the geochemical nature of the clays (Na vs Ca-dominated clays) exerted the strongest control on the porewater chemistry. A pronounced exchange of Na by Ca was observed and simulated, driven by large Ca concentrations in the contacting groundwater. The model was able to link the porewater alterations to the fracture network in the deposition hole. The speed of alterations was in turn linked to high diffusion coefficients under the applied temperatures, which facilitated the propagation of hydrochemical changes into the clays. With diffusion coefficients increased by up to one order of magnitude at the maximum temperatures, the study was able to demonstrate the importance of considering temperature-dependant diffusion in understanding and predicting geochemical alterations of engineered barriers systems after relatively short exposure times following waste emplacement. © 2016},

abstract={An agent-based-Nash modeling framework has been developed to find a sustainable solution for groundwater management in Daryan Aquifer, Fars Province, Iran. This framework also includes a MODFLOW simulation model, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) optimization model. Groundwater state was simulated using MODFLOW and it was calibrated based on the measured data provided by Regional Water Organization (RWO) of Fars Province. In order to reduce the computational time, an ANN was trained and validated based on the input-output data of the MODFLOW model to estimate groundwater level. The validated ANN was linked to a nonhomogeneous elitist NSGA-II multi-objective optimization model to find a Pareto optimal front among the three objectives of reducing irrigation water deficit, increasing equity in water allocation, and reducing groundwater drawdown, as the objectives of the three main groundwater resource stakeholders; farmers, the government executive sector, and the environmental protection institutes. The Nash bargaining model was applied to the optimal solutions in order to find a compromise among the stakeholders. Social influential factors in the study environment, and policy mechanisms to encourage agents to cooperate with the management decisions were implemented in the agent-based model. These factors include training, incentives, penalties, and social norming (neighbors’ impacts), as well as considering the executive and judicial systems. After application of the agent-based model, computed optimum solutions were modified according to social conditions. Finally, the Nash bargaining model was used again to find a compromise among modified optimal objectives of the stakeholders. Implementation of this solution led to 58.3% less water extraction and approximately 3 m water level uplift. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In models of coupled human and natural systems (CHANS), the role of individuals and human behavior is often overlooked as data are scarce and assumptions hard to verify. To assess this role, we couple an agent-based model simulating farmers' behavior and a groundwater model and apply the models to the case of groundwater-fed irrigation in a river basin in the High Plains Aquifer region. Results show the crucial role of human behavior in driving the interactions between these coupled systems. Conversely, individuals are impacted by the systems’ dynamics in different ways depending on physical, economic and social characteristics. The findings provide implications for local policy making and education and demonstrate that assumptions on human behavior could be treated as an additional source of uncertainty. This work suggests that modeling individuals and human behavior can be an important step to simulate and understand the dynamics of CHANS in a holistic way. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work is focused on the development of an electrochemical sensor for the quantification of Cd(II) based on the use of glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) modified with a dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) covalently functionalized with cysteine (Cys). Cd(II) is preconcentrated at the electrode surface by complex formation at open circuit potential, followed by the reduction at −0.900 V and the final anodic voltammetric stripping in a 0.020 M acetate buffer solution pH 5.00. The functionalization of SWCNTs was performed through the reaction between the carboxylic groups of oxidized SWCNT and amino groups of S-triphenylmethyl cysteine using a coupling chemistry agent based on benzotriazol for the activation of carboxylic residues. There was a linear relationship between Cd oxidation signal and Cd(II) concentration between 1.0 and 300.0 μgL−1 Cd(II), with a sensitivity of (49 ± 2) × 10−3 μAμg−1L and a detection limit of 0.3 μgL−1. The reproducibility was 1.7% using the same dispersion and 3.8% using 3 different dispersions. The sensor was challenged with groundwater samples enriched with Cd(II) showing excellent recovery percentages and excellent agreement with the values obtained by ICP-MS. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Water is a fundamental resource, yet its spatiotemporal availability in East Africa is poorly understood. This is the area where most hominin first occurrences are located, and consequently the potential role of water in hominin evolution and dispersal remains unresolved. Here, we show that hundreds of springs currently distributed across East Africa could function as persistent groundwater hydro-refugia through orbital-scale climate cycles. Groundwater buffers climate variability according to spatially variable groundwater response times determined by geology and topography. Using an agent-based model, grounded on the present day landscape, we show that groundwater availability would have been critical to supporting isolated networks of hydro-refugia during dry periods when potable surface water was scarce. This may have facilitated unexpected variations in isolation and dispersal of hominin populations in the past. Our results therefore provide a new environmental framework in which to understand how patterns of taxonomic diversity in hominins may have developed. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Groundwater is critical to global food security, environmental flows, and millions of rural livelihoods in the face of climate change 1 . Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture 2, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model 3,4 of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation 5,6 and collective action 7 and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n = 90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Hybrid socio-hydrological modeling has become indispensable for managing water resources in an increasingly unstable ecology caused by human activity. Most work on the subject has been focused on either qualitative socio-political recommendations with an unbounded list of vague factors or complex sociological and hydrological models with many assumptions and specialized usability. In this paper, we propose a simple agent-based socio-hydrological decision modeling framework for coupling dynamics associated with social behavior and groundwater contamination. The study shows that using social health risk, instead of contaminant concentration, as an optimization variable improves water management decisions aimed at maximizing social wellbeing. The social models and computational framework are designed with enough flexibility and simplicity to encourage extensions to more general socio-hydrological dynamics without compromising either computability or complexity for better data-/model-driven environmental management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={For agent-based modeling, the major challenges in deriving agents’ behavioral rules arise from agents’ bounded rationality and data scarcity. This study proposes a “gray box” approach to address the challenge by incorporating expert domain knowledge (i.e., human intelligence) with machine learning techniques (i.e., machine intelligence). Specifically, we propose using directed information graph (DIG), boosted regression trees (BRT), and domain knowledge to infer causal factors and identify behavioral rules from data. A case study is conducted to investigate farmers' pumping behavior in the Midwest, U.S.A. Results show that four factors identified by the DIG algorithm- corn price, underlying groundwater level, monthly mean temperature and precipitation- have main causal influences on agents’ decisions on monthly groundwater irrigation depth. The agent-based model is then developed based on the behavioral rules represented by three DIGs and modeled by BRTs, and coupled with a physically-based groundwater model to investigate the impacts of agents’ pumping behavior on the underlying groundwater system in the context of coupled human and environmental systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A parallel emergency management method is put forward, in order to solve the problem of emergency management of mine water inrush. The artificial model of mine water inrush system is constructed by making the main elements of mine water inrush system as mapping objects based on multi-agent system. Water inrush computational experiment is studied by 4D management in the orient. Based on the two aspects of the water inrush perception in normal state and the experimental auto emergency plan, the parallel execution of system is discussed. The method can directly affect or change the actual system by artificial system, so it is the concept of awareness and understanding of nature, and use or changing the nature. It can provide feasible integrated management and control for mine water inrush safety management. © 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.},

abstract={Including stakeholders in environmental model building and analysis is an increasingly popular approach to understanding ecological change. This is because stakeholders often hold valuable knowledge about socio-environmental dynamics and collaborative forms of modeling produce important boundary objects used to collectively reason about environmental problems. Although the number of participatory modeling (PM) case studies and the number of researchers adopting these approaches has grown in recent years, the lack of standardized reporting and limited reproducibility have prevented PM's establishment and advancement as a cohesive field of study. We suggest a four-dimensional framework (4P) that includes reporting on dimensions of (1) the Purpose for selecting a PM approach (the why); (2) the Process by which the public was involved in model building or evaluation (the how); (3) the Partnerships formed (the who); and (4) the Products that resulted from these efforts (the what). We highlight four case studies that use common PM software-based approaches (fuzzy cognitive mapping, agent-based modeling, system dynamics, and participatory geospatial modeling) to understand human-environment interactions and the consequences of ecological changes, including bushmeat hunting in Tanzania and Cameroon, agricultural production and deforestation in Zambia, and groundwater management in India. We demonstrate how standardizing communication about PM case studies can lead to innovation and new insights about model-based reasoning in support of ecological policy development. We suggest that our 4P framework and reporting approach provides a way for new hypotheses to be identified and tested in the growing field of PM. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Management of groundwater resources and remediation of groundwater pollution require reliable quantification of contaminant dynamics in natural aquifers, which can involve complex chemical dynamics and challenge traditional modeling approaches.

Previous Lagrangian solvers have been limited to fundamental bimolecular reactions in typically one-dimensional porous media. In contrast to other existing studies, this study developed a fully Lagrangian framework, which was used to simulate diffusion-controlled, multi-step reactions in one-, two-, and three-dimensional porous media. The interaction radius of a reactant molecule, which controls the probability of reaction, was derived by the agent-based approach for both irreversible and reversible reactions. A flexible particle tracking scheme was then developed to build trajectories for particles undergoing mixing-limited, multi-step reactions. The simulated particle dynamics were checked against the kinetics for diffusion-controlled reactions and thermodynamic well-mixed reactions in one- and two-dimensional domains. Applicability of the novel simulator was further tested by (1) simulating precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals in a two-dimensional medium, and (2) quantifying multi-step chemical reactions observed in the laboratory. The flexibility of the Lagrangian simulator allows further refinement to capture complex transport affecting chemical mixing and hence reactions. © 2018 Hohai University},

abstract={Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems contribute to reducing fossil energy consumption by providing sustainable space heating and cooling for buildings by seasonal storage of heat. ATES is important for the energy transition in many urban areas in North America, Europe and Asia. Despite the modest current ATES adoption level of about 0.2% of all buildings in the Netherlands, ATES subsurface space use has already grown to congestion levels in many Dutch urban areas. This problem is to a large extent caused by the current planning and permitting approach, which uses too spacious safety margins between wells and a 2D rather than 3D perspective. The current methods for permitting and planning of ATES do not lead to optimal use of available subsurface space, and, therefore, prevent realization of the expected contribution of the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by ATES. Optimal use of subsurface space in dense urban settings can be achieved with a coordinated approach towards the planning and operation of ATES systems, so-called ATES planning. This research identifies and elaborates crucial practical steps to achieve optimal use of subsurface space that are currently missing in the planning method. Analysis from existing ATES plans and exploratory modeling, coupling agent-based and groundwater models were used to demonstrate that minimizing GHG emissions requires progressively stricter regulation with intensifying demand for ATES. The simulations also quantified both the thresholds beyond which such stricter rules are needed as well as the effectiveness of different planning strategies, which can now effectively be used for ATES planning in practice. The results provide scientific insight in how technical choices in ATES well design, location and operation affect optimal use of subsurface space, and what trade-offs exist between the energy efficiency of individual systems and the combined reduction of the GHG emissions from a plan area. The presented ATES planning method following from the obtained insights now fosters practical planning and design rules suitable to ensure optimal and sustainable use of subsurface space – that is, maximizing GHG emission reductions by accommodating as many ATES systems as possible in the available aquifer, while maintaining a high efficiency for the individual ATES systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Water security assessment based on the concept of blue versus green water is becoming widely accepted globally. Blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content (i.e. mediated by plants). Due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed, an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on blue versus green water security. By loosely coupling an agent based probabilistic land use change model with a hydrologic model, we investigated the consequences of present trends of urban growth to identify potential future hotspots of hydrological change across a watershed in central New Jersey undergoing suburbanization. The agent based probabilistic model, working at the scale of land ownership parcels, predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest, rather than farm land conversion. Using existing zoning maps, the housing unit density and human population of the urban growth areas was estimated. A consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface leading was higher blue water but lower green water. While no severe blue water scarcity was observed, an increasing green water scarcity was found in some study area sub-basins. Such information will aid watershed managers’ and policymakers’ effort in sustainably managing water resources under changing land use and climate. © 2018},

abstract={The present study aims to identify and assess the parameters affecting agent behaviors and to simulate their effects on groundwater resources under the existing water regulations and policies. For this purpose, agent-based models are exploited to simulate the different groups of agents including Regional Water Authority, Public Prosecutor's Office, and the stakeholders as well as their interactions. The systems dynamic model is employed to investigate the effects of changes in agent behaviors on groundwater resources. The Any Logic software package is also used as a powerful tool for simulating both models and identifying the relationships between human behavior and water resources. Two efficient and inefficient scenarios are defined for assessing the effects of such parameters as ‘meetings of regional water agencies held with other public organizations”. Results revealed that changes in the behavior and interactions of Regional Water Authority with other public organizations under the first (inefficient) scenario led to increased renewable storage by 11.6 MCM while elimination of this parameter in the second (efficient) scenario led to a decrease of 52.6 MCM in renewable storage. Results of both scenarios showed that proper interactions of the Regional Water Authority with other stakeholders led to the control of illegal water abstractions and the rise of water table in the aquifers from the scenario one 1777.4 m–1778.1 m under the second scenario. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries. Multiple management units that differ in scale, constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach. The interactions among water managers, water users, and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community-level water supply and groundwater availability. This research develops an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands. The ABM is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table. The framework is applied to explore trade-offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin-level. A group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in Verde River Basin, Arizona. The framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user, municipal, and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long-term water resilience. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In flat environments, groundwater is relatively shallow, tightly associated with surface water and climate, and can have either positive and negative impacts on natural and human systems depending on its depth. A linked modelling and analysis framework that seeks to capture linkages across multiple scales at the climate/water/crop nexus in the Argentine Pampas is presented. This region shows a strong coupling between climate, soil water, and land use due to its extremely flat topography and poorly developed drainage networks. The work describes the components of the framework and, subsequently, presents results from simulations performed with the twin goals of (i) validating the framework as a whole and (ii) demonstrating its usefulness to explore interesting contexts such as unexperienced climate scenarios (wet/dry periods), hypothetical policies (e.g., differential grains export taxes), and adoption of non-structural technologies (e.g., cover crops) to manage water table depth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is confronted with a severe freshwater crisis shaped by excess water demand and intermittent public supply. In Jordan's capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35-45% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption. The outcome of this analysis could be relevant for policy attempting to enhance freshwater sustainability in Jordan. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Unsustainable groundwater use has led to the lowering of groundwater levels and the degradation of groundwater-dependent ecosystems worldwide. Integrated hydrologic-ecological-economic models have been developed to simulate and optimize the coupled human and groundwater systems, and address the issue of unsustainable groundwater use. However, a lack of understanding of the heterogeneity of groundwater users undermines the performance of the integrated models. In this paper, an agent-based model is developed using a two-stage optimization strategy with the goal of optimizing the decision making of heterogeneous farmers on crop choice and groundwater irrigation. The performance of the optimization strategy is evaluated under the influence of four behavioral factors. The results illustrate that the optimization strategy can lead to higher crop profits or a slower rate of groundwater depletion in comparison with the observations, but does not necessarily guarantee the optimal solution in balancing these two objectives. In order to achieve sustainable groundwater use, the roles that behavioral factors play in farmers' decision making need to be better understood, and better accounted for in groundwater policy. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={A river basin usually provides water for multiagent. Imperfect coordination mechanisms among these agents, however, usually lead to serious water shortage, pollution, and ecological degradation. Therefore, it is vital to conduct research on allocating different kinds of water resources among multiagent including the water quantity agent, water quality agent and environment agent within a river basin. This paper proposes an optimization-simulation method that takes into consideration engineering measures, including water transfer projects, reservoirs, canal heads, and pump stations; multi-water resources such as local surface water, transferred water, groundwater, and reused sewage; and multiagent for remitting serious water problems. In the proposed optimization-simulation method, the groundwater and reused sewage are first allocated according to the water resources allocation simulation module (Module 1). Then, local surface and transferred water are allocated based on the water resources allocation optimization module (Module 2), which comprises water quantity, water quality and environment agents’ objectives based on synergism. Finally, the instream water quality is simulated according to the water quality simulation module (Module 3). Results show that, compared to the current situation, the water quantity and environment agent guarantee rates can satisfy the design requirements in the planning year of 2020. The regulated instream water quality is also improved; although, it still remains relatively poor. Water quality in the downstream is worse than that in the upstream. In addition, the water quality shows a positive correlation with the instream streamflow. These results certify the proposed optimization-simulation method can provide support for efficacious multiagent water resources allocation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The modelling of social-ecological systems can provide useful insights into the interaction of social and environmental processes. However, quantitative social-ecological models should acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty of both underlying subsystems. For example, the agent-based models which are increasingly popular for groundwater studies can be made more realistic by incorporating geohydrological processes. Conversely, groundwater models can benefit from an agent-based depiction of the decision-making and feedbacks which drive groundwater exploitation. From this perspective, this work introduces a Python-based software architecture which couples the NetLogo agent-based platform with the MODFLOW/SEAWAT geohydrological modelling environment. This approach enables users to design agent-based models in NetLogo's user-friendly platform, while benefiting from the full capabilities of MODFLOW/SEAWAT. This workflow is illustrated for a simplified application of Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES). © 2019},

abstract={Incentive-based policies, such as the cap-and-trade system, have been shown to be useful in the context of groundwater management. This study compares the performance of a groundwater market with water quotas when assumptions of perfect information are violated due to climate change and hydrogeologic heterogeneity and explores how changes in future climate affect market performance. A subbasin of the Republican River Basin, overlying the Ogallala aquifer in the High Plains of the United States, is used as a case study. Building on a previously developed model, a multiagent system model simulating a groundwater market is developed where self-interested agents can trade water use permits to maximize individual benefits subject to irrigation and land constraints. This economic model is coupled with a calibrated physically based groundwater model for the study region that allows for an evaluation of streamflow depletion impacts, which has been the focus of management efforts in the basin. Results show that trading of permits between farmers results in increased economic benefits and, in some cases, reduced environmental violations. However, the benefits of a groundwater market are distributed unequally resulting in “winners” and “losers” across the system. Future changes in climate are shown to significantly influence farmers willingness to pay for groundwater and thus increase the variation in groundwater price and pumping. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing hydroclimatologic variability and change in the design of groundwater markets. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Paddies in the river network area in plains of southern China produce large amount of drainage discharge in the growing season. Pesticides applied to the paddy fields can be observed in adjacent drainage ditches as they traveled with surface and shallow subsurface drainage, or deposited with the wind drift when they are not thoroughly degraded right after application. Consequently, the surrounding water bodies including the drainage ditches and ponds would be contaminated by the pesticides, which poses a potential threat to the aquatic ecological environment. Based on a field monitoring study in the Farmland Water Conservancy Scientific Research Station of Jiangdu District, Yangzhou, China, we conducted high-frequency (with the shortest sampling interval of 1 h) and short-term (3-day duration) sampling in the upper and middle sections of drainage ditches, surface water and ground water in paddies right after pesticide application. The concentrations of chlorpyrifos (CPF) and abamectin (ABM) (two commonly used paddy insecticides) were analyzed. The results showed that peak concentrations appeared twice within 5 h after application in the adjacent drainage outlet for both insecticides; the peak concentrations of CPF and ABM were 0.33 mg/L and 4.60 μg/L, respectively in the field ditch, the peak concentration of CPF was much higher than the acute water quality criteria of CPF in the Yangtze River delta region (0.013-0.112 μg/L). Concentrations of the two insecticides decreased rapidly when there was no outflow in the field ditch, indicating that controlled drainage might have a great impact on the concentration variations in ditches. The concentrations of CPF and ABM were much lower in ditches between 36 and 72 h after their applications; CPF concentrations varied from 0.007 to 0.020 mg/L and ABM concentrations were lower than 0.1 μg/L. Concentrations of CPF in the water bodies around paddies decreased in the order of the field ditch (0.007-0.33 mg/L) to surface water of paddies (0.004-0.050 mg/L), and then to ground water of paddies (0.000 6-0.002 mg/L). A time lag was observed for the concentration variations in different sites of the field ditch. When pesticides application was based on the recommended dose for paddies (80 g per 667 m2 for CPF, 50 mL per 667 m2 for ABM), CPF had high to extremely high risks to majority of the concerned aquatic animals, while ABM had only low to medium risks to the most aquatic animals. CPF had extremely high risks to 8 out of 16 fishes and high to extremely high risks to 5 different shrimps or crabs. ABM had low to medium risks to 16 out of 19 fishes and low risks to 3 shrimp or crab species. The safe concentrations of CPF calculated with two methods were 1.2×10-5-0.384 9 mg/L and 6×10-6-0.194 0 mg/L, respectively. The environmental exposure concentration of CPF in paddies after pesticide application was larger than the safety concentrations of most evaluated aquatic animals, while different results were obtained for ABM. Results from this study indicate adverse environmental and ecological effects of the monitored insecticides application in paddies; they may provide valuable scientific reference for ecological risk management of pesticides and agricultural non-point source pollution control. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

abstract={Confronted with diverse water management schemes, policymakers in arid basins face difficulty in choosing a particular scheme due to a lack of appropriate tools to estimate possible physical and economic outcomes in a comprehensive manner. This study develops a coupled agent-hydrologic model to both capture and provide insights into the dynamics and patterns of real-world water management using the midstream area of the Heihe River Basin in northern China as a case study. Water consumption patterns, economic efficiency, and environmental externalities of three different management schemes, namely an administered scheme (AS), a surface-water market scheme (SWMS), and a surface-water-groundwater market scheme (SGWMS) are evaluated. The results show that an agent's (irrigation district) behaviors under market schemes are determined by the difference between equilibrium price and pumping cost, related to water table depth. The annual total benefits are improved under market schemes, especially in dry years. Negative environmental effects of the market schemes do occur but are not significant. The travel time of groundwater corresponds to a delay longer than 2 months in upper agents' pumping influence on drawdown. In general, the proposed model application in this study addresses complex real-world management issues by presenting physically interpretable and verifiable outcomes, and therefore aids policymakers in decision making by providing a broader view of water management. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Mangrove marshes are a significant global ecosystem, finely-tuned to contemporary sea level. As sea level rises the mangrove-to-freshwater ecotone reflects underlying groundwater salinity indicating the transformation of freshwater resources into saltwater unsuitable for consumption or agriculture. Hydrological numerical models can predict this dynamic given sufficient environmental detail, however, detailed data is often lacking. Alternatively, agent-based models can predict landscape vegetation changes and the associated fresh-to-saline water transformation based only on landscape surface features. We apply such a model to the southern tip of the Florida peninsula at the nexus of a metropolis and World Heritage wildlife preserve: the Florida Everglades, to predict ecotone dynamics and aquifer water resources in response to warming climate and rising sea level. The model is based on species-specific behaviors for freshwater grasses and salt-tolerant red mangroves with relevance to global mangrove ecosystems. © 2019},

abstract={The objective of the present paper is to propose a framework for development of an optimal cropping pattern aimed at ground water recovery using an agent based approach. In the proposed agent-based model (ABM), the agents’ learning from each other as well as their self-learning from their own behavioral feedback was studied through simulation of the behavior of agricultural agents using fuzzy inference system (FIS). Moreover, the agents’ behavior were determined using linear programming in order to maximize the farmers’ income. The governmental agent regulated the interactions between agricultural and environmental agents by imposing its policies in the form of scenarios. The efficiency of the presented methodology was evaluated using hydrological data of Najaf Abad region, located in Iran’s central plain, on the basis of three hydrological scenarios (wet, normal, and dry) subject to governmental policy of aquifer recovery. The results showed that in a normal scenario with current groundwater withdrawal, the water level reduced by an average of 0.18 m per year. In contrast, the water level increased by an average of 0.48 m under aquifer recovery scenario. Furthermore, despite 17% reduction in water rights of agricultural agents in the study area, the total long-term agricultural income declined only by less than 4%, and in the planning horizon, their average annual income associated with these two management scenarios were estimated at 123.5 and 119 million US dollars, respectively. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={Groundwater depletion is arguably one of humanity's greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century. With Sustainable Development Goals only a decade away, water authorities around the world are in the urgent need for concrete and targeted measures to ensure that communities adhere to groundwater management policies as rapidly and as effectively as possible. In this paper, we combine computational social science, groundwater modelling and empirical data from the World Values Survey to generate future ensembles of hydro-social trajectories under alternative courses of management and social action or inaction. Our simulations shed new light on the role that cultural values can play in shaping the societal trajectories and norms that emerge when resources are either allocated or not sufficiently allocated to monitor compliance, issue fines, engage community leaders, and deter rule-breakers. This study presents a new approach to explore and evaluate the capacity of existing and future management actions to steer groundwater systems towards sustainable trajectories, to forecast the celerity and timing of social transformations at the inter-decadal scale, and to help nations identify the most pertinent management options under institutional, political, social, and/or cultural constraints. The methods presented here are broadly applicable to support strategic decisions that rely on the monitoring, enforcement, and compliance of environmental regulations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Policy making for complex Social-Ecological Systems (SESs) is a multi-factorial and multi-stakeholder decision making process. Therefore, proper policy simulation in a SES should consider both the complex behavior of the system and the multi-stakeholders’ interventions into the system, which requires integrated methodological approaches. In this study, we simulate impacts of policy options on a farming community facing water scarcity in Rafsanjan, Iran, using an integrated modeling methodology combining an Agent Based Model (ABM) with Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). First, the behavioral rules of farmers and the causal relations among environmental variables are captured with FCMs that are developed with both qualitative and quantitative data, i.e. farmers' knowledge and empirical data from studies. Then, an ABM is developed to model decisions and actions of farmers and simulate their impacts on overall groundwater use and emigration of farmers in this case study. Finally, the impacts of different policy options are simulated and compared with a baseline scenario. The results suggest that a policy of facilitating farmers' participation in management and control of their groundwater use leads to the highest reduction of groundwater use and would help to secure farmers’ activities in Rafsanjan. Our approach covers four main aspects that are crucial for policy simulation in SESs: 1) causal relationships, 2) feedback mechanisms, 3) social-spatial heterogeneity and 4) temporal dynamics. This approach is particularly useful for ex-ante policy options analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Integrated urban water management (IUWM) is a comprehensive mitigation strategy to control water deficit due to simultaneous effects of reduction in water resources capacity and increase in water demand. Here we develop a coupled agent-based risk-based optimization model, which is able to account for water resources capacity and water demand uncertainties to determine the optimum annual water allocation. An optimization model based on conditional value at risk (CVaR) is employed to minimize the water supply risk in a long-term horizon and obtain the annual probabilities of complete supply of water demand. According to the generated synthetic weather data by LARS-WG for different climate scenarios, surface water and groundwater resources are modeled using HMETS and MODFLOW, respectively. Then, the developed agent-based model considers agents’ attributes, action roles and interactions by applying Borda scoring approach, and determines the most compatible IUWM strategies to increase water supply or modify water demand. The proposed framework is implemented for the Shiraz city in Iran, revealing a strong need to IUWM strategies to alleviate the water deficit over the period of 2018 to 2050. The proposed approach provides an efficient framework to achieve sustainable management strategies for cities with stressed water resources and rapid urban development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},
